# Antora Site Mapper

The Site Mapper is a component in Antora responsible for generating the sitemap files for the site.
These files, which are intended to be read by crawlers, provide a list of all published pages by URL.
The sitemap entries are partitioned by component into sitemap index files, which are then referenced by the main sitemap file.

[Antora](https://antora.org) is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
Its site generator aggregates documents from versioned content repositories and processes them using [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org).
