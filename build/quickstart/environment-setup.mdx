## Introduction

Welcome to the first installment of the Deploy your first contract guide! ðŸ¥‡

As a popular phrase (often attributed to Abraham Lincoln) says, "Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe".
The first installment of the series will therefore guide you through setting up your development environment, which will include the three most recommended tools to begin developing on Starknet:

* *Scarb*, a build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet ecosystems

* *Starknet Foundry*, the go-to framework for building and testing Starknet Smart Contracts

* *Starknet Devnet*, a Rust implementation of a local Starknet node

<Tip>
To review all Starknet developer tools, see [Developer tools](/learn/cheatsheets/tools).
</Tip>

## Setting up your environment on MacOS and Linux

On MacOS and Linux, Scarb, Starknet Foundry and Starknet Devnet can be easily installed using the [Starkup installer](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) by running:

```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

and following the onscreen instructions.

<Note>
If you prefer to install the tools manually or encounter issues with Starkup, see [Setting up your environment manually on MacOS and Linux](/build/quickstart/appendix#setting-up-your-environment-manually-on-macos-and-linux).
</Note>

You can verify that all three tools are installed correctly by running:

```bash
   scarb --version
   snforge --version && sncast --version
   starknet-devnet --version
```

If the installation was successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
scarb 2.11.4 (c0ef5ec6a 2025-04-09)
cairo: 2.11.4 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.11.4)
sierra: 1.7.0

snforge 0.48.1
sncast 0.48.1

starknet-devnet 0.4.3
```

<Note>
Starkup installs Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet on MacOS and Linux via the [`asdf` version manager](https://asdf-vm.com/), which allows to easily switch between their different versions, both globally and per project (see full details in the [`asdf` documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/commands.html) or by running `asdf --help`). Alongside Scarb and Starknet Foundry, Starkup uses `asdf` to install additional useful tools, including the [Universal Sierra Compiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler), [Cairo Profiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler), [Cairo Coverage](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage), and [CairoLS](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols).

If you encounter any issues while using it or have any requests, please help by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup/issues/new).

## Setting up your environment on Windows

Setting up Scarb and Starknet Foundry on Windows requires configuring the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and installing the tools inside a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.

### Installing WSL and Ubuntu

1. Open PowerShell as administrator and run:

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

   This command installs WSL along with the default Ubuntu distribution. If WSL or virtualization is not yet enabled, reboot and re-run the command as needed.

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

3. After reboot, launch Ubuntu from the Start menu. On the first launch, create a UNIX username and password when prompted.

<Note>
If `wsl --install` does not work, enable WSL manually by running:

```bash
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

and installing Ubuntu from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore).
</Note>

### Installing prerequisites in Ubuntu

1. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential
   ```

### Installing Homebrew

1. Run the Homebrew install script:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Add Homebrew to your shell environment:

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
   source ~/.profile
   ```

3. Verify that Homebrew was installed correctly:

   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

### Installing `asdf`

<Note>
Using `asdf` allows you to easily switch between versions of Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet globally or per project.
</Note>

1. Install `asdf` using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install asdf
   ```

2. Add `asdf` to your shell:

   ```bash
   echo '. "$(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Verify that `asdf` is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   asdf --version
   ```

### Installing Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet

1. Add the Scarb plugin and install the latest Scarb version:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add scarb
   asdf install scarb latest
   asdf set -u scarb latest
   ```

2. Add the Starknet Foundry plugin and install the latest Starknet Foundry version:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
   asdf install starknet-foundry latest
   asdf set -u starknet-foundry latest
   ```

3. Add the Starknet Devnet plugin and install the latest Starknet Devnet version:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
   asdf install starknet-devnet latest
   asdf set -u starknet-devnet latest
   ```

4. Restart your terminal and verify that Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet were installed correctly:

   ```bash
   scarb --version
   snforge --version && sncast --version
   starknet-devnet --version
   ```

   <Tip>
   If `scarb`, `snforge`, or `starknet-devnet` are not recognized, try running `source ~/.bashrc` or restarting your terminal.
