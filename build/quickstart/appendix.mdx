## Setting up your environment manually on MacOS and Linux

### Installing WSL and Ubuntu

Setting up Scarb and Starknet Foundry on Windows requires configuring the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and installing the tools inside a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu:

1. Open PowerShell as administrator and run:

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

   This command installs WSL along with the default Ubuntu distribution.
   If WSL or virtualization is not yet enabled, reboot and re-run the command as needed.

   <Note>
   If `wsl --install` does not work, enable WSL manually by running:

   ```bash
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
   ```

   and installing Ubuntu from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore).
   </Note>

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

3. After reboot, launch Ubuntu from the Start menu.
   On the first launch, create a UNIX username and password when prompted.

4. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential
   ```

### Installing Homebrew

1. Run the Homebrew install script:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Add Homebrew to your shell environment:

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
   source ~/.profile
   ```

3. Verify that Homebrew was installed correctly:

   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

### Installing `asdf`

<Info>
Using `asdf` allows you to easily switch between versions of Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet globally or per project.
</Info>

1. Install `asdf` using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install asdf
   ```

2. Add `asdf` to your shell:

   ```bash
   echo '. "$(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Verify that `asdf` is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   asdf --version
   ```

### Installing Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet

1. Add the Scarb plugin and install the latest Scarb version:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add scarb
   asdf install scarb latest
   asdf set -u scarb latest
   ```

2. Add the Starknet Foundry plugin and install the latest Starknet Foundry version:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
   asdf install starknet-foundry latest
   asdf set -u starknet-foundry latest
   ```

3. Add the Starknet Devnet plugin and install the latest Starknet Devnet version:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
   asdf install starknet-devnet latest
   asdf set -u starknet-devnet latest
   ```

4. Restart your terminal and verify that Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet were installed correctly:

   ```bash
   scarb --version
   snforge --version && sncast --version
   starknet-devnet --version
   ```

   <Note>
   If `scarb`, `snforge`, or `starknet-devnet` are not recognized, try running `source ~/.bashrc` or restarting your terminal.
   </Note>

## Fetching a predeployed Sepolia account

**Procedure:**

1. Export the private key from your wallet by:
   * For Ready wallets: navigating to `Settings` -> `<YOUR_ACCOUNT>` -> `Export Private Key`.
   * For Braavos wallets: navigating to `Settings` -> `Privacy and Security` -> `Export Private Key`.

2. Create a keystore file by running:

```terminal
starkli signer keystore from-key keystore.json
```

and entering the private key of your smart wallet, along with a password that will be used to encrypt it.

3. Fetch the account by running:

```terminal
starkli account fetch \
    <SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS> \
    --output account.json \
    --network=sepolia
```


## Troubleshooting

### Starkli unable to detect shell

**Procedure:**

1. Detect whether your shell is `zsh` or `bash`:

```terminal
echo $SHELL
```

2. Add:

```terminal
. /Users/<NAME>/.starkli/env
```

to either `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

3. Restart the terminal, and run either:

```terminal
source ~/.zshrc
```

or:

```terminal
source ~/.bashrc
```

### `scarb build` fails to run version command for Rust

Starting from Scarb version 2.10 and Starknet Foundry version 0.37.0, Rust is longer required for projects with the following line in their `Scarb.toml` file:

```cairo
[tool.scarb]
allow-prebuilt-plugins = ["snforge_std"]
```

If not all three conditions are met and Rust is not installed, running `scarb build` (and `scarb test`) will result in a compilation error. To resolve this, either update Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and your `Scarb.toml` file accordingly or [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### `starkli declare` unable to identify compiler version

When using `starkli declare`, Starkli will do its best to identify the compiler version of the declared class. In case it fails, the `--compiler-version` flag can be used to specify the version of the compiler.

**Procedure:**

1. Find the compiler versions supported by Starkli by running:

```terminal
starkli declare --help 
```

and looking for the possible values of the `--compiler-version` flag.

2. Find the current Scarb version in use:

```terminal
scarb --version
```

3. In case a different compiler version is required, switch to a different Scarb version using `asdf`:

   a. Install the desired Scarb version:

   ```terminal
   asdf install scarb <VERSION>
   ```

   b. Select the desired Scarb version as the local version for the project:

   ```terminal
   asdf set scarb <VERSION>
   ```
