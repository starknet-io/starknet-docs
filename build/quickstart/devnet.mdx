## Introduction

Welcome to the third installment of the *Deploy your first contract* guide! ðŸ¥‡

Local networks, also known as development networks or *devnets*, enable a fast and private development process, making them ideal for taking your first Starknet steps. This installment of the series will therefore guide you through the steps necessary to declare, deploy, and interact with the `HelloStarknet` contract on your very own local instance of Starknet.

## Initializing a local Starknet instance

A local Starknet instance can be easily initialized using Starknet Devnet by simply running:

```bash
starknet-devnet --seed=0
```

<Note>
The `--seed` option is used to force consistent addresses of predeployed account (see more details below).
</Note>

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
Chain ID: SN_SEPOLIA (0x534e5f5345504f4c4941)

Predeployed FeeToken
ETH Address: 0x49D36570D4E46F48E99674BD3FCC84644DDD6B96F7C741B1562B82F9E004DC7

...
```

<Note>
Starknet Devnet should keep running for the following sections to work.
</Note>

## Fetching a predeployed account

<Tip>
To learn more about Starknet accounts, check out the [Accounts section](/learn/protocol/accounts/).
</Tip>

To interact with your local Starknet instance, you first need an account. Luckily, the result of initializing a local Starknet instance using Starknet Devnet should also include a list of predeployed accounts that resembles the following:

```console
| Account address |  0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691
| Private key     |  0x0000000000000000000000000000000071d7bb07b9a64f6f78ac4c816aff4da9
| Public key      |  0x039d9e6ce352ad4530a0ef5d5a18fd3303c3606a7fa6ac5b620020ad681cc33b

| Account address |  0x078662e7352d062084b0010068b99288486c2d8b914f6e2a55ce945f8792c8b1
| Private key     |  0x000000000000000000000000000000000e1406455b7d66b1690803be066cbe5e
| Public key      |  0x007a1bb2744a7dd29bffd44341dbd78008adb4bc11733601e7eddff322ada9cb

...
```

This allows to avoid creating and deploying new accounts, and instead simply importing them to Starknet Foundry. To import your local node's first predeployed account, use a new terminal window to navigate into the `hello_starknet` directory created in [Generating `HelloStarknet`](/build/quickstart/hellostarknet#creating-hellostarknet) and run:

```bash
sncast account import \
    --address=0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691 \
    --type=oz \
    --url=http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --private-key=0x0000000000000000000000000000000071d7bb07b9a64f6f78ac4c816aff4da9 \
    --add-profile=devnet \
    --silent
```

<Tip>
To learn more about `sncast account import`, see the [Starknet Foundry documentation](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/appendix/sncast/account/import.html).
</Tip>

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
Success: Account imported successfully

Account Name: account-1
Add Profile:  Profile devnet successfully added to /app/snfoundry.toml
```

## Declaring `HelloStarknet` locally

Before a contract can be deployed on Starknet, its compiled code needs to be submitted to the network (also known as *declaring* it).

<Tip>
To learn more about distinction between deploying a contract and declaring it, see [the Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch100-01-contracts-classes-and-instances.html).
</Tip>

To declare the `HelloStarknet` contract, run:

```bash
sncast --profile=devnet declare \
    --contract-name=HelloStarknet
```

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
Success: Declaration completed

Class Hash:       0x51e0d3b26fb79035afdc64d2214eb18291629b4f2ef132e79c3f3fbe1ba57c4
Transaction Hash: 0x76e28641d96ee0788f5a960931ee717c5dae36f95f227c02d5578a6898d8af3
```

where `class_hash` is the contract's class hash, which can then be used to deploy an instance of it.

<Tip>
To learn more about the class hashes, check out [the Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch100-01-contracts-classes-and-instances.html).
</Tip>

## Deploying `HelloStarknet` locally

With `HelloStarknet` declared, you can now deploy an instance of it by running:

```bash
sncast --profile=devnet deploy \
    --class-hash=0x051e0d3b26fb79035afdc64d2214eb18291629b4f2ef132e79c3f3fbe1ba57c4 \
    --salt=0
```

<Note>
The `--salt` option is used to force a consistent address for the deployed contract.
</Note>

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
Success: Deployment completed

Contract Address: 0x04035c4db7822523478996bfc2b80d925e671279bb99ed1fb4e4fcc222e344e6
Transaction Hash: 0x04d11358b809c7b8a5aae1a1cf0e72e0b436fb2d0a2dd1a26d009fec7aa74280
```

## Interacting with `HelloStarknet` locally

Now that your instance of `HelloStarknet` is deployed, you can interact with via its functions by either calling or invoking them.

Calling is used for read functions that don't modify their contract's storage, and allows querying a smart contract function without sending a transaction. For example, you can call `HelloStarknet`'s `get_balance` function by running:

```bash
sncast --profile=devnet call \
    --contract-address=0x04035c4db7822523478996bfc2b80d925e671279bb99ed1fb4e4fcc222e344e6 \
    --function=get_balance
```

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
Success: Call completed

Response:     0x0
Response Raw: [0x0]
```

Invoking is used for write functions that modify their contract's storage, and submits a transaction to the network that changes its state. For example, you can invoke `HelloStarknet`'s `increase_balance` function by running:

```bash
sncast --profile=devnet invoke \
    --contract-address=0x04035c4db7822523478996bfc2b80d925e671279bb99ed1fb4e4fcc222e344e6 \
    --function=increase_balance \
    --arguments=42
```

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

```console
Success: Invoke completed

Transaction Hash: 0x02691af0fb2b720b27ae17c844d72244b8fc35f3a3d57b6549736d9a88f8f014
```

You can verify that your deployed contract's storage â€” and by extension, the state of your local Starknet instance â€” has indeed changed by calling `get_balance` again. If all goes well, the result should resemble the following ($42_{10} = 2a_{16}$):

```console
Success: Call completed

Response:     0x2a
Response Raw: [0x2a]
```
