# Simple Defi Vault

This is the Cairo adaptation of the [Solidity by Example - Vault](https://solidity-by-example.org/defi/vault/).
Here's how it works:

- When a user deposits a token, the contract calculates the amount of shares to mint.

- When a user withdraws, the contract burns their shares, calculates the yield, and withdraws both the yield and the initial amount of tokens deposited.
