# Local environment setup

This guide walks through setting up a Starknet development environment, creating a project, and compiling your first smart contract.

::::steps

## Install toolchain with `starkup`

Run this one-time setup command to install essential Starknet tools:

```bash [Terminal]
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.dev | sh
```

This installs:
- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs.html) - Cairo package manager
- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/) - Testing framework
- [Cairo Language Server](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols) - for IDE support
- Additional compiler, profiling and coverage tools

<Note>
While you could use a more minimal toolchains, this curated set provides:
- Active maintenance from core contributors
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Integrated dependency and version management
</Note>

## Create new project with `scarb`

Create a new Starknet project with Scarb:

```bash [Terminal]
scarb new my_starknet_project
```

When prompted, select **Starknet Foundry** as the test runner.

Scarb version should matches Cairo version:

```bash [Terminal]
cd my_starknet_project
scarb --version
```

Take a look at the generated `Scarb.toml{:md}` file. It manages:
- Project metadata
- Dependencies and workspace configuration
- Build profiles, compiler settings
- Project and tool configurations

## Compile smart contract with `scarb build`

The template includes a starter `HelloStarknet` contract in `src/lib.cairo{:md}`. Compile it with:

```bash [Terminal]
scarb build
```

Compilation artifacts can be found in `target/dev/{:md}`, where `dev` is the default build profile:
- `my_starknet_project_HelloStarknet.contract_class.json{:md}` - The contract class

## Next steps

You're now ready to modify the sample contract in `lib.cairo{:md}`.
We will cover the rest of the tools in the next sections.

As a bonus step, we recommend you to explore the [Scarb documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs.html)

<Info>
For reproducible environments:

1. Create a `.tool-versions{:md}` file at project root:

```md [.tool-versions]
cairo 2.10.1
scarb 2.10.1
```

Sync versions with:
```bash [Terminal]
asdf install
```

2. Use `scarb.lock{:md}` to lock dependencies, which is automatically generated by `scarb build{:bash}`.
Be sure to commit this file if using version control.

This ensures consistent tool versions and reproducible builds across installations.
