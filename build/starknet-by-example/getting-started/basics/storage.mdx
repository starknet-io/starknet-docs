## Introduction

You can define storage variables to store and retrieve data in your contract.

Storage in Cairo contracts is implemented as a key-value store using a struct marked with the `#[storage]` attribute.

Every contract must have exactly one storage definition, which serves as the contract's persistent state on the blockchain and is kept between contract executions.

## Storage space & pointers

The contract's storage space consists of $2^{251}$ *storage slots*, where each slot:

- Can store a single `felt252` value
- Is initialized to 0

Storage variables are stored in storage slots using Starknet's memory model abstraction called **storage pointers**.
A storage pointer is a tuple `(base_address, offset)` where:

- `base_address` is the address of the first slot where the variable is stored
- `offset` is the distance from the base address where the variable is stored

To get the base address of a storage variable, you can use the `selector!` macro to derive it from the variable name (i.e., `selector!("variableÂ§_name")`).

## Example

```rust
mod Contract {
    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        a: u128,
        b: u8,
        c: u256,
    }
}
```

The storage layout of this contract is:

- Variable `a` (`u128`):
  - Base address: `selector!(`"a")`
  - Uses lowest 128 bits of the slot at offset 0
  - Leaves 124 bits unused
- Variable `b` (`u8`):
  - Base address: `selector!("b")`
  - Uses lowest 8 bits of the slot at offset 0
  - Leaves 244 bits unused
- Variable `c` (`u256`):
  - Base address: `selector!("c")`
  - Too large for a single slot, uses two consecutive slots:
    - First slot: lower 128 bits at offset 0
    - Second slot: lower 128 bits at offset 1
  - Leaves 248 bits unused, 124 in each slot

<Tip>
Notice how many bits are left unused in each slot?
This can make storage operations expensive.
To optimize storage usage, you can pack multiple variables together.
