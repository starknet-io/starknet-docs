# Testing Contracts

Testing plays a crucial role in software development, especially for smart contracts. In this section, we'll guide you through the basics of creating test suites for your contracts.

There's two main *test runners* for Cairo:

<div class="flex justify-center">
| Test Runner                                        | Scope               | Best For                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **[Snforge](./testing-snforge)**        | Starknet contracts  | Full smart contract testing with blockchain state  |
| **[Cairo Test](./testing-cairo-test)**  | Pure Cairo packages | Non-blockchain-state logic validation / testing |
</div>

<Warning>
Start with **Snforge** for Starknet contracts! 

When you project is getting more complex, try to separate the logic into pure Cairo packages.
You can then use **Cairo Test** to test these packages independently.
