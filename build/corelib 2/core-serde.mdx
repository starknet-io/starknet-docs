Serialization and deserialization of data structures.
This module provides traits and implementations for converting Cairo types into a sequence of
`felt252` values (serialization) and back (deserialization).
When passing values between Cairo and an external environment, serialization and deserialization
are necessary to convert Cairo's data types into a sequence of `felt252` values, as `felt252` is
the fundamental type of the language.
# The `Serde` Trait

All types that need to be serialized must implement the `Serde` trait. This includes both simple
types that serialize to a single `felt252` and compound types (like `u256`) that require
multiple `felt252` values.
