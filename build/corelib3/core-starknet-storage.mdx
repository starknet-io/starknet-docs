# storage

Storage-related types and traits for Cairo contracts.
This module implements the storage system for Starknet contracts, providing high-level
abstractions for persistent data storage. It offers a type-safe interface for reading and
writing to Starknet storage through the `StoragePointerReadAccess` and
`StoragePointerWriteAccess` traits, along with useful storage-only collection types like
[`Vec`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-Vec.md) and [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md).
# Overview

The storage system in Starknet contracts is built on a key-value store where each storage slot
is identified by a 251-bit address. The storage system allows interactions with storage using
state variables, which are declared inside a `Storage` struct annotated with the `#[storage]`
attribute. This ensures type-safe storage access and simplifies the process of reading and
writing to storage.
# Using the Storage System

Storage is typically declared using the `#[storage]` attribute on a struct:
```cairo
#[storage]
struct Storage {
    balance: u256,
    users: Map<ContractAddress, User>,
    nested_data: Map<ContractAddress, Map<ContractAddress, u8>>,
    collection: Vec<u8>,
}
```

Any type that implements the `Store` trait (or it's optimized `StorePacked` variant) can be used
in storage.  This type can simply be derived using `#[derive(Store)]` - provided that all of the
members of the type also implement `Store`.
```cairo
#[derive(Copy, Default, Drop, Store)]
struct User {
    name: felt252,
    age: u8,
}
```

Interaction with storage is made through a set of traits, depending on the type interacted
with:
- `StoragePointerReadAccess` and `StoragePointerWriteAccess` allow for reading and writing
storable types.
- [`StorageMapReadAccess`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StorageMapReadAccess.md) and [`StorageMapWriteAccess`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StorageMapWriteAccess.md) allow for reading and writing to
storage [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md)s.
- [`StoragePathEntry`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StoragePathEntry.md) allows for accessing a specific entry in a [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md), and can be combined
with the `StoragePointer` traits to read and write in these entries.
- [`VecTrait`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-VecTrait.md) and [`MutableVecTrait`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-MutableVecTrait.md) allow for interacting with storage [`Vec`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-Vec.md)s.
## Examples

```cairo
fn use_storage(self: @ContractState) {
    let address = 'address'.try_into().unwrap();
    // Reading values
    let balance = self.balance.read();
    // For a `Map`, use the `entry` method to access values at specific keys:
    let user = self.users.entry(address).read();
    // Accessing nested `Map`s requires chaining `entry` calls:
    let nested = self.nested_data.entry(address).entry(address).read();
    // Accessing a specific index in a `Vec` requires using the `index` method:
    let element = self.collection[index];

    // Writing values
    self.balance.write(100);
    self.users.entry(address).write(Default::default());
    self.nested_data.entry(address).entry(address).write(10);
    self.collection[index].write(20);
}
```
# Storage Lifecycle

When you access a storage variable, it goes through several transformations:

1. FlattenedStorage: The starting point is your contract's storage struct. Each member is
represented either as a `StorageBase` or another `FlattenedStorage` (for `#[substorage(v0)]`
or `#[flat]` members).

2. StorageBase: For simple variables, this holds the `sn_keccak` hash of the variable name,
which becomes the storage address. For example:
```cairo
#[storage]
struct Storage {
    balance: u128,  // Stored at sn_keccak('balance')
}
```


3. StoragePath: For complex types, a `StoragePath` represents an un-finalized path to a
specific entry in storage. For example, a `StoragePath` for a `Map` can be updated with
specific keys to point to a specific entry in the map.

4. StoragePointer: The final form, pointing to the actual storage location. For multi-slot
values (like structs), values are stored sequentially from this address.
# Storage Collections

Cairo's memory collection types, like `Felt252Dict` and [`Array`](./core-array-Array.md), can not be used in storage.
Consequently, any type that contains these types can not be used in storage either.
Instead, Cairo has two storage-only collection types: [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md) and [`Vec`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-Vec.md).
Instead of storing these memory collections directly, you will need to reflect them into
storage using the [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md) and [`Vec`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-Vec.md) types.
# Address Calculation

Storage addresses are calculated deterministically:

- For a single value variable, the address is the `sn_keccak` hash of the variable name's ASCII
encoding. `sn_keccak` is Starknet's version of the Keccak-256 hash function, with its output
truncated to 250 bits.

- For variables composed of multiple values (tuples, structs, or enums), the base storage
address is also the `sn_keccak` hash of the variable name's ASCII encoding. The storage layout
then varies depending on the specific type. A struct will store its members as a sequence of
primitive types, while an enum will store its variant index, followed by the members of the
variant.

- For variables within a storage node, the address is calculated using a chain of hashes that
represents the node structure. Given a member `m` within a storage variable `variable_name`,
the path is computed as `h(sn_keccak(variable_name), sn_keccak(m))`, where `h` is the Pedersen
hash. For nested storage nodes, this process repeats, creating a hash chain representing the
path to each leaf node. At the leaf node, the storage calculation follows the standard rules for
that variable type.

- For [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md) or [`Vec`](./core-starknet-storage-vec-Vec.md) variables, the address is calculated relative to the storage base
address (the `sn_keccak` hash of the variable name) combined with the mapping keys or vector
indices.
See their respective module documentation for more details.
