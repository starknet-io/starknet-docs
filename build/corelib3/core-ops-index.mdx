# index

Indexing traits for indexing operations on collections.
This module provides traits for implementing the indexing operator `[]`, offering two distinct
approaches to access elements in collections:
- [`IndexView`](./core-ops-index-IndexView.md) - For snapshot-based access
- [`Index`](./core-ops-index-Index.md) - For reference-based access

For safe indexing operations that return `Option`, see the unstable [`Get`](./core-ops-get-Get.md) trait
in the [`get`](./core-ops-get-Get.md) module.
# When to use which trait

- Use [`IndexView`](./core-ops-index-IndexView.md) when the collection can be accessed in a read-only context and is not
mutated by a read access. This is the most common case in Cairo.
- Use [`Index`](./core-ops-index-Index.md) when the input type needs to be passed as `ref`. This is mainly useful for types
depending on a [`Felt252Dict`](./core-dict-Felt252Dict.md), where dictionary accesses are modifying the data structure
itself.

Only one of these traits should be implemented for any given type, not both.
