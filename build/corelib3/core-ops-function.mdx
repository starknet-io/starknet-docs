# function

Function traits and types.
This module defines traits for function-like types that can be called.
The two main traits are:
- [`FnOnce`](./core-ops-function-FnOnce.md) - For single-use functions that consume their environment
- [`Fn`](./core-ops-function-Fn.md) - For reusable functions that can be called multiple times
# Examples

```cairo
// Using Fn for a reusable operation
fn apply_twice<F, +Drop<F>, +core::ops::Fn<F, (u32,)>[Output: u32]>(f: F, x: u32) -> u32 {
    f(f(x))
}

let double = |x| x * 2;
assert!(apply_twice(double, 2) == 8);
```
