== Building and previewing content locally

After writing or editing content, to preview your changes:

. Build the content by running the `build_local_site.sh` build script:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./build_local_site
----
+
This command generates the website in the directory `public_html`.
. Open the website by doing one of the following:
+
* Open the start page: `<repo_root>/public_html/index.html`.
* Run the xref:http_server[http server] packaged with Antora:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ http-server public_html -c-1
----
+
The server runs, and gives you one or more local URLs that you can use to view the website. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
