== Different ways to contribute

There are a few different ways you can contribute to Starknet documentation:

* Create a link:https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs/issues[GitHub issue].
* Submit a pull request (PR). You can create a local clone of your own fork of the link:https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs[starknet-docs repository], make your changes, and submit a PR. This option is best if you have substantial changes, or to help the changes you want to be added more quickly.

*What happens when you submit a PR?*

When you submit a PR, the https://github.com/orgs/starknet-io/teams/starknet-docs[Starknet Docs team] reviews the PR and arranges further technical reviews as necessary. If the PR requires changes, the reviewers add comments to the PR. We might request that you make the changes, or let you know that we incorporated your content in a different PR. Occasionally, we might add commits to the original PR directly. When the PR has been reviewed and all updates are complete, the documentation team merges the PR and applies it to the valid version(s).

====
There are multiple ways of coding ids, source code blocks, cross-references, and links. In general we use the most explicit coding conventions for coding in order to prioritize code readability. Most of these coding conventions are listed in link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/asciidoc-markup-conventions/[AsciiDoc Mark-up Quick Reference for Red Hat Documentation]

== Building and previewing content locally

After writing or editing content, to preview your changes:

. Build the content by running the `build_local_site.sh` build script:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./build_local_site
----
+
This command generates the website in the directory `public_html`.
. Open the website by doing one of the following:
+
* Open the start page: `<repo_root>/public_html/index.html`.
* Run the xref:http_server[http server] packaged with Antora:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ http-server public_html -c-1
----
+
The server runs, and gives you one or more local URLs that you can use to view the website. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
Starting up http-server, serving *public_html*

== Releasing Starknet docs on Github
_The high-level process for releasing documentation changes in this repository._

During the course of content development, writers merge branches with changes either directly into `master`, into a secondary branch as needed, where these changes wait until we are ready to release them—that is, post them to link:https://docs.starknet.io[docs.starknet.io].

Github actions create Git tags and releases that appear at the repo’s link:https://github.com/starknet-community-libs/starknet-docs/releases[Releases] and link:https://github.com/starknet-community-libs/starknet-docs/tags[Tags] pages.

When a feature branch is merged into the `master` branch, a github action creates a release tag in the format `v<version>.<major_update>.<minor_update>` and updates `CHANGELOG.md`. It then publishes the new content to docs.starknet.io.

=== Procedure

Merging a feature branch to `master` automatically publishes changes in the feature branch. No additional steps are required.

Github increments the version numbers in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, and updates `CHANGELOG.md` with the descriptions of each PR that was just merged into `master`.
. Update your local `master` branch from the remote `master` branch using one of the following:

* Pull the changes:
+
[source,bash]
----
starknet-docs (master) git pull
----
* Do a rebase from `git@github.com:starknet-io/starknet-docs.git`:
[source,bash]
----
starknet-docs (master) git fetch origin
starknet-docs (master) git rebase origin/master
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using a fork, then your forked repo is `origin` by default, in which case you would assign the name `upstream` to `git@github.com:starknet-io/starknet-docs.git`. So when rebasing, use `upstream` instead of `origin` in the above commands.
