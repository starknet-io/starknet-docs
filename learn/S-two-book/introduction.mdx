# Introduction

Stwo is a state-of-the-art framework for creating STARK proofs that provides the following features:

- A frontend designed to be flexible to allow you to express your own constraints
- A backend that leverages Circle STARKs over the Mersenne31 prime field for fast prover performance
- Seamlessly integrated with Cairo

This book will guide you through the process of creating your own constraints and then proving them using Stwo. It will also provide in-depth explanations of the inner workings of how Stwo implements Circle STARKs.
