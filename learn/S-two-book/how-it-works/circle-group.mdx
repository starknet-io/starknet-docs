# Circle Group

As discussed in the previous section, Mersenne prime field $\textsf{M31}$ lacks a smooth subgroup whose order is a large power of two. This property makes such fields unsuitable for instantiating STARK protocols. To address this, we consider extensions of $\textsf{M31}$ that have smooth subgroups, which are suitable for performing FFTs and implementing the FRI protocol.

For a field extension $F$ of $\textsf{M31}$, we define the _circle curve_ $C(F)$ as the set of points $(x, y) \in F^2$ satisfying the relation:
$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$

In Stwo implementation, a point on the circle is defined as follows:

```rust
pub struct CirclePoint<F> {
    pub x: F,
    pub y: F,
}
```

The set $C(F)$ forms a cyclic group under the operation defined by:
$$(x,y) + (x', y') = (xx' - yy', xy' + x'y)$$

Here, the group is defined additively, which differs from the multiplicative notation used in the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle STARKs paper</a>. In this documentation, we adopt the additive notation for consistency with the implementation. The above group operation is implemented as:

```rust
    fn add(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        let x = self.x.clone() * rhs.x.clone() - self.y.clone() * rhs.y.clone();
        let y = self.x * rhs.y + self.y * rhs.x;
        Self { x, y }
    }
```

The identity element in this group is $(1, 0)$, implemented as:

```rust
    pub fn zero() -> Self {
        Self {
            x: F::one(),
            y: F::zero(),
        }
    }
```

Negation in the circle group corresponds to the conjugation map $J$, defined by:
$$J(x, y) = (x, -y)$$
This is same as complex conjugation in complex numbers. In Stwo, the conjugate of a `CirclePoint` is computed as:

```rust
    pub fn conjugate(&self) -> CirclePoint<F> {
        Self {
            x: self.x.clone(),
            y: -self.y.clone(),
        }
    }
```

The total number of points in the circle group $C(F)$ is given by $|F| + 1$. Specifically, for $C(\textsf{M31})$, the number of points is $P + 1$, which, as discussed earlier, is a large power of two and can thus be used in STARK protocol instantiations. This result is proven in _Lemma 1_ of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle STARKs paper</a>.

In Stwo implementation, the generator $g$ of the group $C(\textsf{M31})$ is defined as:
$$g = (2, 1268011823)$$
Subgroups of $C(\textsf{M31})$ of size $2^n$ can be generated using the following function:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
    pub fn subgroup_gen(n: u32) -> CirclePoint<F> {
        assert!(n <= M31_CIRCLE_LOG_ORDER); // M31_CIRCLE_LOG_ORDER = 31
        let s = 1 << (M31_CIRCLE_LOG_ORDER - n);
        M31_CIRCLE_GEN.mul(s) // M31_CIRCLE_GEN = g = (2, 1268011823)
    }
```

To generate a subgroup $\langle g_n \rangle$ of size $2^n$, the function computes $2^{31 - n} \cdot g$, i.e. it applies the group law to the generator $g$ with itself $2^{31 - n}$ times, as shown below:

```rust
    pub fn mul(&self, mut scalar: u128) -> CirclePoint<F> {
        let mut res = Self::zero();
        let mut cur = self.clone();
        while scalar > 0 {
            if scalar & 1 == 1 {
                res = res + cur.clone();
            }
            cur = cur.double();
            scalar >>= 1;
        }
        res
    }
```

Hence, the point $2^{31-n} \cdot g$ serves as a generator of a subgroup $\langle g_n \rangle$ of order $2^n$.

## Circle Domain

In a STARK protocol, the computation trace is interpolated as a low-degree polynomial over a domain using FFT. For Circle STARKs, this domain consists of points on the circle curve and is referred to as the _circle domain_. The circle domain $D_n$ of size $2^n$ is constructed as the union of two disjoint cosets:
$$D_n = q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle \cup -q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$$
Here, $\langle g_{n-1} \rangle$ is a subgroup of size $2^{n-1}$, and $q$ is the coset offset such that $q \neq -q$. This union is also called the _twin-coset_. The second coset in the union can be viewed as the negation (or conjugation) of the first:
$$J(q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle) = -q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$$
Therefore, it suffices to store only the half coset $q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$, and generate the full domain via its conjugates. The circle domain is defined in Stwo as:

```rust
pub struct CircleDomain {
    pub half_coset: Coset,
}
```

The following figure shows a circle domain of size 8. It is constructed from the half coset $q + \langle g_2 \rangle$ of size 4 (shown as red points) and its negation $-q + \langle g_2 \rangle$ (shown as blue points).

To iterate over all points in the circle domain, we can iterate over the half coset and its conjugates:

```rust
    pub fn iter(&self) -> CircleDomainIterator {
        self.half_coset
            .iter()
            .chain(self.half_coset.conjugate().iter())
    }
```

## Canonic Coset

For a specific choice of offset $q$, the twin-coset $D_n$ becomes a coset of a larger subgroup. In particular, if $q$ is a generator of a subgroup of order $2^{n+1}$, then:
$$D_n = q + \langle g_n \rangle = q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle \cup -q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$$
This result is proven in _Proposition 1_ of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle STARKs paper</a>. Such domains are called _standard position coset_, or are referred to as _canonic cosets_. They are implemented as follows:

```rust
pub struct CanonicCoset {
    pub coset: Coset,
}
```

Here, `CanonicCoset` represents the full coset $q + \langle g_n \rangle$, while `CircleDomain` is represented with its half coset $q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$. Thus to compute the `CircleDomain` from the `CanonicCoset`, first calculate the half coset $q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$, which will be used to initialize the `CircleDomain` as shown below:

```rust
    pub fn circle_domain(&self) -> CircleDomain {
        CircleDomain::new(self.half_coset())
    }
```

The following figure shows a canonic coset of size 8. It is constructed from the coset $\langle g_3 \rangle$ of size 8 followed by an offset by $q$, where $q$ is the generator of subgroup $\langle g_4 \rangle$.

We can verify whether a given `CircleDomain` is _canonic_ by checking the step size of the half coset against the initial coset offset. In the `CircleDomain` implementation, only the _half coset_ $q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$ is explicitly stored. If `CircleDomain` is canonic, $q$ must be a generator of the subgroup $\langle g_{n+1} \rangle$, which has order $2^{n+1}$ i.e. $q = 2^{31 - (n+1)} \cdot g$. Recall that the generator of the subgroup $\langle g_{n-1} \rangle$ is $2^{31 - (n-1)} \cdot g$.

Thus, the step size between consecutive elements in the half coset is $2^{31 - (n-1)} \cdot g$, and the initial point is $q = 2^{31 - (n+1)} \cdot g$. Therefore, the ratio between the step size and the initial coset offset is:

$$\frac{2^{31 - (n-1)}}{2^{31 - (n+1)}} = 2^2 = 4$$

This means that in a canonic coset, the step size is exactly four times the initial coset offset. This condition is used to check whether a `CircleDomain` is canonic, as shown below:

```rust
    pub fn is_canonic(&self) -> bool {
        self.half_coset.initial_index * 4 == self.half_coset.step_size
    }
```

In the next section, we will dive into polynomials defined over the circle.
