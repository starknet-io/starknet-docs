> In STARK protocols, the computation trace is organized into columns and represented as polynomials. This section explains how S-two represents and manipulates polynomials over the circle, covering both point-value (evaluations) and coefficient representations.

This section is organized as follows:

- **[Columns](/learn/S-two-book/how-it-works/circle-polynomials/columns)**: How computation trace data is stored in columns, including both base field and secure field representations.
- **[Circle Evaluations and Polynomials](/learn/S-two-book/how-it-works/circle-polynomials/evals-and-poly)**: Point-value and coefficient representations of polynomials, their mathematical foundations, and conversion between forms.
- **[Secure Evaluations and Polynomials](/learn/S-two-book/how-it-works/circle-polynomials/secure-evals-and-poly)**: Extension to secure field polynomials using the quartic extension QM31, with implementation details.
