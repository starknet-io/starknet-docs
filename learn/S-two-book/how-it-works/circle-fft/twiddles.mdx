# Twiddles

This section provides a detailed look at how twiddles are computed and stored in S-two.

<Callout type="info">
As discussed earlier, S-two has two main backend implementations: `CpuBackend` and `SimdBackend`. Each backend implements the `PolyOps` trait, which provides core polynomial operations such as interpolation, evaluation and twiddle precomputation. Here and in the following sections on Circle FFT, we will explore how these functions are implemented for the `CpuBackend`.
</Callout>

## Twiddle Tree

The twiddles are stored using the `TwiddleTree` struct implemented as follows:

```rust
pub struct TwiddleTree<B: PolyOps> {
    pub root_coset: Coset,
    // TODO(shahars): Represent a slice, and grabbing, in a generic way
    pub twiddles: B::Twiddles,
    pub itwiddles: B::Twiddles,
}
```

For `CpuBackend`, `B::Twiddles` is a vector of `BaseField` elements. Here, `root_coset` is the half coset $q + \langle g_{n-1} \rangle$ of our circle domain $D_n$. As we have seen in the earlier section, for interpolation we divide by twiddles or multiply by inverse twiddles. In the evaluation algorithm, we multiply by twiddles. Thus we store both `twiddles` and their inverses `itwiddles`.

Now we will understand how the twiddle tree is computed using an example. Consider the following half coset $q + \langle g_2 \rangle$ of a circle domain $D_3$.

The `TwiddleTree` is constructed by the `precompute_twiddles` function, which takes the half coset as input and produces the twiddles needed to perform FFT over the corresponding circle domain. It is implemented as follows:

```rust
    fn precompute_twiddles(coset: Coset) -> TwiddleTree<Self> {
        const CHUNK_LOG_SIZE: usize = 12;
        const CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 1 << CHUNK_LOG_SIZE;

        let root_coset = coset;
        let twiddles = slow_precompute_twiddles(coset);

        // Inverse twiddles.
        // Fallback to the non-chunked version if the domain is not big enough.
        if CHUNK_SIZE > root_coset.size() {
            let itwiddles = twiddles.iter().map(|&t| t.inverse()).collect();
            return TwiddleTree {
                root_coset,
                twiddles,
                itwiddles,
            };
        }

        let mut itwiddles = vec![BaseField::zero(); twiddles.len()];
        twiddles
            .array_chunks::<CHUNK_SIZE>()
            .zip(itwiddles.array_chunks_mut::<CHUNK_SIZE>())
            .for_each(|(src, dst)| {
                batch_inverse_in_place(src, dst);
            });

        TwiddleTree {
            root_coset,
            twiddles,
            itwiddles,
        }
    }
```
As shown above, it first computes `twiddles` using the function `slow_precompute_twiddles` then computes their inverses `itwiddles` using batch inversion and finally stores them in the `TwiddleTree` along with the `root_coset` which is the input half coset.

Now let us look into the function `slow_precompute_twiddles`.

```rust
pub fn slow_precompute_twiddles(mut coset: Coset) -> Vec<BaseField> {
    let mut twiddles = Vec::with_capacity(coset.size());
    for _ in 0..coset.log_size() {
        let i0 = twiddles.len();
        twiddles.extend(
            coset
                .iter()
                .take(coset.size() / 2)
                .map(|p| p.x)
                .collect::<Vec<_>>(),
        );
        bit_reverse(&mut twiddles[i0..]);
        coset = coset.double();
    }
    // Pad with an arbitrary value to make the length a power of 2.
    twiddles.push(1.into());
    twiddles
}
```

The above function computes the twiddles required to compute FFT over the line (i.e. the recursive layer FFT, after projecting to the $x$-axis). For the example in the figure with the half coset points $[(a, b), (b, -a), (-a, -b), (-b, a)]$, this function will output $[a, b, \pi(a), 1]$.

Thus, for the half coset in the figure, the `precompute_twiddles` will output `TwiddleTree` with `twiddles` as $[a, b, \pi(a), 1]$ and `itwiddles` as $[a^{-1}, b^{-1}, \pi(a)^{-1}, 1]$. The `twiddles` will be used for the evaluation algorithm and `itwiddles` will be used for the interpolation algorithm.

In the next section, we will bring together everything we've covered so far on Circle FFT to examine the implementation of the interpolation algorithm.
