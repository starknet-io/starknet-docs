# Circle FRI

> This section introduces the Circle FRI protocol, which is used to check proximity to low-degree polynomials. We provide a technical overview, walk through a concrete example, and detail the implementation of both the prover and verifier.

This section is organized as follows:

- **[Technical Overview](./overview)**: Explains the mathematical foundations and protocol steps of Circle FRI, including a multi-table example and security analysis.
- **[FRI Prover](./fri_prover)**: Describes the implementation of the prover, including protocol configuration, commitment, and decommitment phases.
- **[FRI Verifier](./fri_verifier)**: Details the verifier's implementation, covering query generation and verification logic.
