# Hello World

Let's first set up a Rust project with Stwo.

```bash
$ cargo new stwo-example
```

We need to specify the nightly Rust version to use Stwo.

```bash
$ echo -e "[toolchain]\nchannel = \"nightly-2025-01-02\"" > rust-toolchain.toml
```

Now let's edit the `Cargo.toml` file as follows:

```rust,ignore
[package]
name = "stwo-examples"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
license = "MIT"

[dependencies]
stwo = { git = "https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo.git", rev = "75a6b0ac9bcc7101d8658445dded51923ab2586f", features = ["prover"]}
stwo-constraint-framework = { git = "https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo.git", rev = "75a6b0ac9bcc7101d8658445dded51923ab2586f", package = "stwo-constraint-framework", features = ["prover"] }
num-traits = "0.2.17"
itertools = "0.12.0"
rand = "0.8.5"
```

We are all set!
