# AIR Development

> This section is intended for developers who want to create custom proofs using Stwo (proofs of custom VMs, ML inference, etc.). It assumes that the reader is familiar with Rust and has some background knowledge of cryptography (e.g. finite fields). It also assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of proof systems and knows what they want to create proofs for, but it does not assume any prior experience with creating them.

<Callout type="info">
All the code that appears throughout this section is available [here](../stwo-examples/index).
</Callout>
