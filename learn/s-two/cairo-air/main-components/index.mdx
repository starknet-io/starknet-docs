Now that we have a basic understanding of how Cairo works and the basic building blocks that are used to build the Cairo AIR, let's take a look at the main components of the Cairo AIR.

<Note>
For readers who are unfamiliar with the concepts of components and lookups, we suggest going over the [Components](../../air-development/components/index.mdx) section of the book.

## Fetch, Decode, Execute

Cairo follows the common CPU architecture of fetching, decoding, and executing an instruction in a single CPU step. Below is a high-level diagram of what a single CPU step looks like in Cairo.

Since we need to prove the correctness of all CPU steps, the Cairo AIR writes the results of fetching, decoding, and executing an instruction at every CPU step into a trace and proves that the constraints over the trace are satisfied—i.e., consistent with the semantics of Cairo.

Let's keep this in mind while we go over the main components of the Cairo AIR.

## 1. Memory Component
The first component we need is a `Memory` component, which implements the non-deterministic read-only memory model of Cairo.

In Cairo AIR, instead of mapping the memory address to a value directly, we first map the `address` to an `id` and then map the `id` to a `value`. This is done to classify the memory values into two groups: `Small` and `Big`, where `Small` values are 72-bit integers and `Big` values are 252-bit integers. As many memory values do not exceed the `Small` size, this allows us to save cost on unnecessary padding.

As a result, the `Memory` component is actually 2 components: `MemoryAddressToId` and `MemoryIdToValue`.
The constraints for the `MemoryAddressToId` and `MemoryIdToValue` components are as follows:

1. An `address` must appear once and only once in the `MemoryAddressToId` component.
2. Each `(address, id, value)` tuple must be unique.

The first constraint is implemented by using a preprocessed column that contains the sequence of numbers `[0, MAX_ADDRESS)` and using this as the address values (in the actual code, the memory address starts at 1, so we need to add 1 to the sequence column).

The second constraint is guaranteed because the `address` value is always unique.
<Note>
A short explainer on how the `id` value is computed:
The `id` value is a 31-bit integer that is incremented by 1 from 0 whenever there is a unique memory access. For example, if the addresses `[5, 1523, 142]` were accessed in that order, the ids for those addresses will be `(5, 0)`, `(1523, 1)`, and `(142, 2)`.

Since an `id` value needs to include information as to whether the corresponding `value` is `Small` or `Big`, we use the MSB as a flag (0 for `Small` and 1 for `Big`). Thus, an `id` value that corresponds to a `Small` value can occupy the space `[0, 2^30)`, while an `id` value that corresponds to a `Big` value can occupy the space `[2^30, 2^31)`.

In reality, the size of each table will be `[0, NUM_SMALL_VALUES_ACCESSED)` and `[2^30, 2^30 + NUM_BIG_VALUES_ACCESSED)`, where `NUM_SMALL_VALUES_ACCESSED` and `NUM_BIG_VALUES_ACCESSED` are values that are provided by the prover. To make sure that the `id` values are created correctly, we can use the preprocessed column as the `id` values.
</Note>

## 2. VerifyInstruction Component
The `VerifyInstruction` component is responsible for accessing the instruction from the `Memory` component and decomposing the retrieved value. As mentioned in the [Felt252 to M31](../basic-building-blocks/index.md#felt252-to-m31) section, a 252-bit integer is stored as 28 9-bit limbs, so we need to decompose the limbs and concatenate them to get the values we need. For example, in order to get the 3 16-bit offset values, we need to decompose the first 6 limbs into `[9, [7, 2], [9], [5, 4], [9], [3, 6]]` and concatenate them as the following: `[[9, 7], [2, 9, 5], [4, 9, 3]]`. Then, the remaining 6-bit value and the next limb will correspond to the 15-bit flags, and the next (8th) limb will be the opcode extension value. The other 20 limbs should all be zeros. At the end, we will have decomposed the instruction value into 3 16-bit offsets, 2 chunks of flags, and a 9-bit opcode extension.

Note that the decomposition will be constrained by range checking that each integer is within its corresponding range.

## 3. Opcode Component
Since every Cairo instruction can be mapped to a specific `Opcode`, we can check that a Cairo instruction is executed by checking that the corresponding `Opcode` component was executed correctly. You can think of the `Opcode` component as the main component that uses the `VerifyInstruction` and `Memory` components.

We define a single `Opcode` component for each predefined opcode and a `GenericOpcode` component, which is used for all instructions that do not map to any of the predefined opcodes.

The following is a list of constraints that the `Opcode` component needs to verify:
1. The offsets and flag values are correct using the `VerifyInstruction` component.
2. The instruction is correctly mapped to the current `Opcode` component using the flags.
3. The operand values `op0`, `op1`, and `dst` computed with the registers and the offsets are correct using the `Memory` component.
4. The operation for the current `Opcode` component is done correctly.
5. The state transition of the three registers (`pc`, `ap`, `fp`) is done correctly using the flags.
Of these constraints, items 2 and 4 are self-contained—meaning they do not require any other components to be verified. We will explore how the remaining three are verified using lookups between the different components.

## Bringing It All Together

The following figure shows how each of the main components are connected to each other using lookups.
If we look at the right-hand side first, we can see the main components of the Cairo AIR. The boxes in each component correspond to lookups within that component, and boxes with the same fill color correspond to lookups of the same values. Some lookups are yielded (i.e., subtracted), while others are used (i.e., added). Yielded lookups have red edges; used lookups have blue edges.

On the left-hand side, we can see lookups that are computed directly by the verifier from data provided by the prover as part of the proof.

Each component has a **claimed sum** value that corresponds to the sum of all the lookups in the component. These claimed sums are provided by the prover as part of the proof, and the verifier adds them together along with the lookups on the left-hand side. If the total sum is zero, the verifier is convinced that the proof is valid.

### Memory Lookups

The memory lookups correspond to looking up the `(address, id)` and `(id, value)` pairs. In the `Memory` component, each of the lookups is multiplied by a witness value `mult`, which indicates the number of times each memory address was accessed. Since the memory accesses are added to the total sum and the same amount is subtracted from the total sum in the `Memory` component, the total sum for memory lookups should equal zero.
Note that the verifier also adds lookups for the Cairo program, which is necessary to ensure that the correct program is actually stored in memory and is properly executed.

### Instruction Lookups

Once the `VerifyInstruction` component retrieves the instruction value using the `(pc_addr, pc_id)` and `(pc_id, pc_val)` lookups, it subtracts the lookup of the tuple `(pc, dst_off, op0_off, op1_off, flags1, flags2, opcode_extension)`, which are the decomposed values of the instruction. This lookup also has a `mult` witness because the `VerifyInstruction` component has a single row for each unique `pc` value (i.e., the Cairo instruction stored at the `pc` address). Thus, the same `pc` value can be invoked multiple times throughout the program, and the `mult` value represents the number of times the same `pc` value is invoked.
Since the same tuple lookup is added to the total sum whenever the `Opcode` component uses the same instruction, the total sum for instruction lookups should equal zero.

### Register Lookups

After computing over the operands, a Cairo instruction updates the register values based on the values in the flags. In an `Opcode` component, this update logic is verified using the columns `pc`, `ap`, `fp`, `new_pc`, `new_ap`, `new_fp`, and by constraining the values with the flags.
In addition to checking that each state transition is done correctly, we also need to make sure that the initial register values (i.e., before running the program) and the final register values (i.e., after running the program) satisfy the Cairo semantics. For example, the final `pc` must point to an instruction that runs the `JUMPREL 0` opcode, which is an infinite loop (you can check the rest of the semantics enforced [here](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo-cairo/blob/95019d029fdd164091f9d17a12cb9288215fb9c3/stwo_cairo_verifier/crates/cairo_air/src/lib.cairo#L264)).
