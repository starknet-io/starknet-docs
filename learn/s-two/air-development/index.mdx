title: "Foreword"
---

This section is intended for developers who want to create custom proofs using S-two (proofs of custom VMs, ML inference, etc.). It assumes that the reader is familiar with Rust and has some background knowledge of cryptography (e.g. finite fields). It also assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of zero-knowledge proofs and knows what they want to create a zero-knowledge proof for, but it does not assume any firsthand experience with zero-knowledge proof systems.

<Note>
All the code that appears throughout this section is available [here](https://github.com/zksecurity/stwo/tree/main/stwo-examples).
