## Current versions

| Environment | Starknet version | Sierra version | Cairo version |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Mainnet     | 0.13.6          | 1.7.0          | 2.0.0 - 2.12.0 |
| Sepolia     | 0.14.0          | 1.7.0          | 2.0.0 - 2.12.0 |

## Current limits

<Warning>
  The following limits are subject to revisions and change on a regular basis
</Warning>

<Note>
  Starting from v0.13.0, blockifier-related constants and limits are defined for each Starknet version in a JSON file called `versioned_constants` in the [blockifier's resources directory](https://github.com/starkware-libs/sequencer/tree/main/crates/blockifier/resources).
  
  Starting from v0.13.5, resources are denominated in units of L2 gas, L1 gas, and L1 data gas.
</Note>

| Entity | Description | Limit |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Block time | The maximum amount of time within which a pending block is closed, if no other limit is met | 30 seconds |
| Max L2 gas per block | The maximum amount of L2 gas that a block can contain<br/><br/>**Note:** This limit ensures block production times remains consistent and predictable. | Mainnet: 5 * 10^9<br/><br/>Sepolia: 4 * 10^9 |
| Max L2 gas per transaction | The maximum number of computational steps, measured in L2 gas, that a transaction can contain when processed on the Starknet network<br/><br/>**Note:** This limit is important for ensuring the efficient execution of transactions and preventing potential congestion. | 10^9 |
| Max state updates per transaction | The maximum number of storage updates that a single transaction can generate<br/><br/>**Note:** This limit helps maintain network stability and predictable performance. | 2,000 |
| Max number of events per transaction | The maximum number of events that a transaction can emit during its execution | 1,000 |
| Max number of data felts per event | The maximum number of felts that an event can contain in its `data` array | 300 |
| Max number of key felts per event | The maximum number of felts that an event can contain in its `keys` array | 50 |
| Max L2 gas for `validate` | The maximum number of computational steps, measured in Cairo steps, for a `validate` function | 10^8 |
| Max contract bytecode size | The maximum size of the bytecode or program that a smart contract can have on Starknet | 81,920 felts |
| Max contract class size | The maximum size for the Sierra file of a contract class within Starknet<br/><br/>**Note:** This limit is important for ensuring the network's scalability and security. | 4,089,446 bytes |
| IP address limits | The amount of contract reads and writes that a single IP address can make (in order to reduce network spam) | 200 per min per IP address |
| Signature length | The maximum length of a signature | 4,000 felts |
| Calldata length | The maximum length of a transaction calldata | 5,000 felts |

### Block builtin limits

<Warning>
Currently, block builtin limits apply only for Sepolia.

For more information, see [the release notes for Starknet version 0.13.6](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes#starknet_v0_13_6_8_jul_25).
</Warning>

| Builtin | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Range Check | 57,142,857 |
| ECDSA | 3,000 |
| Poseidon | 479,961 |
| Pedersen | 493,827 |
| Bitwise | 6,861,063 |
| EC OP | 6,994 |
| Keccak | 9,790 |
| Range Check 96 | 71,428,571 |
| Add Mod | 16,000,000 |
| Mul Mod | 6,622,516 |

## Deprecated features

<Note>
  A deprecated feature is a feature that is still supported, but support will be removed in a future release of Starknet.
</Note>

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Cairo 0 | [Starknet v0.11.0](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes#version0.11.0) introduces Cairo 1.0 smart contracts. |
| Transaction signing only over two resources | RPC version 0.8, introduced in Starknet 0.13.5, only supports `v3` transactions that sign over three resources (L1 gas, L2 gas and L1 data gas), removing support for transaction versions `v0`, `v1`, and `v2`, and for `v3` transactions that sign only over two resources (L1 gas and L2 gas).<br/><br/>Starting from version v0.14.0, Starknet will stop accepting these transactions altogether, and will only accept `v3` transactions compliant with RPC 0.8. |

## Unsupported and removed features

<Note>
  An unsupported feature is a feature that is no longer supported.
  
  A removed feature is a feature that has been entirely removed.
</Note>

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Starknet CLI | Support for the Starknet CLI has been removed. Instead use [Starkli or Starknet Foundry's `sncast`](./tools). |
| Goerli testnet | Goerli testnet support was removed April 2, 2024. Sepolia testnet replaces Goerli testnet.<br/><br/>Starknet started migrating to Sepolia testnet on November 15th, 2023. For more information on the Goerli deprecation, see [the deprecation announcement on Ethereum's site](https://ethereum.org/nb/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets).<br/><br/>Full nodes, API services, SDKs, and other Starknet developer tools have migrated to Sepolia as well.<br/><br/>**Note:** Sepolia's state and history are relatively small. Sepolia [supports declaring classes of CairoZero and Cairo v2.0.0 and higher](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes). |
| Starknet feeder gateway | The Starknet feeder gateway, a temporary solution for querying the sequencer's state, is being replaced by Starknet full nodes (Pathfinder, Juno, Deoxys, Papyrus) and RPC services. For more information, see [Full nodes and API services](./tools).<br/><br/>Support for the feeder gateway queries that are not required for full nodes to synchronize on the state of Starknet will stop according to the following schedule:<br/><br/>**Environment** \| **Date**<br/>Integration \| 1 November 2023<br/>Testnet \| 15 November 2023<br/>Mainnet \| 19 December 2023<br/><br/>Queries that are required for full nodes to synchronize on the state of Starknet are still supported.<br/><br/>For more information, see the Community Forum post [_Feeder Gateway Deprecation_](https://community.starknet.io/t/feeder-gateway-deprecation/100233). |
| Free L1-> L2 messaging | Previously, sending a message from L1 to L2 had an optional fee associated.<br/><br/>From [Starknet v0.11.0](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes#version0.11.0), the fee mechanism is enforced and the ability to send L1->L2 messages without the corresponding L2 fee has been removed.<br/><br/>See [here](/learn/protocol/messaging#l1-l2-message-fees) for more details. |
| `invoke` transaction v0 | `invoke` transaction v0 has been removed since [Starknet v0.11.0](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes#version0.11.0). |
| `declare` transaction v0 | `declare` transaction v0 has been removed since [Starknet v0.11.0](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes#version0.11.0). |
| `deploy` transaction | The `deploy` transaction has been removed since [Starknet v0.10.3](/learn/cheatsheets/version-notes#version0.10.3).<br/><br/>To deploy new contract instances, you can use the [`deploy` system call](https://book.cairo-lang.org/appendix-08-system-calls.html#deploy). |
