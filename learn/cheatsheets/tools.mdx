[starknet.swift](https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.swift?tab=readme-ov-file#starknetswift),
and [starknet.dart](https://starknetdart.dev/)
are Starknet's various software development kits (SDKs)

## dApp tools

* [Scaffold Stark](https://scaffoldstark.com/) is designed to make it easier for developers to create, deploy and interact with smart contracts.
* [Starknet React](https://github.com/apibara/starknet-react) is a wagmi-inspired collection of React hooks for Starknet.
* [Get Starknet](https://github.com/starknet-io/get-starknet) is a Starknet wallet\<>dApp connection bridge, that enables easy discovery and UI for Starknet wallets, including Ready, Braavos, Metamask Snaps, and OKX.
* [Starknetkit](https://www.starknetkit.com/) is a Starknet wallet connection kit, built by Ready using Starknet.js and starknet-react.
* [Dynamic SDK](https://go.dynamic.xyz/4eFmNMI) combines authentication, smart wallets, and secure key management into one flexible SDK that enables multi-chain coverage across chains and third-party wallets.
* [Dojo](https://www.dojoengine.org/) is a developer friendly framework for building provable Games, Autonomous Worlds and other Applications that are natively composable, extensible, permissionless and persistent.
* [Chipi SDK](https://sdk.chipipay.com/introduction) is an open-source developer toolkit that enables Starknet applications to create non-custodial wallets using any social login (Google, Apple, Telegram, etc.), sponsor transactions via integration with [AVNU's Paymaster](/learn/cheatsheets/integrations#infrastructure), and build with their favourite auth provider with no black boxes.
* [Cavos](https://aegis.cavos.xyz/) is a wallet infrastructure service that enables instant wallet creation, gasless transactions, multi-provider authentication, and cross-platform SDKs

## AI tools

* [Cairo Coder](https://www.cairo-coder.com/) is an intelligent code generation service that uses advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to understand Cairo's syntax, patterns, and best practices, and provide high-quality, functional Cairo code based on natural language descriptions.
* [Starknet Agent](https://agent.starknet.io/), an AI-powered search engine that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to search and understand the Starknet documentation, Cairo Book, and other resources and provide clear and accurate answers to any queries.
* [Snak](https://www.starkagent.ai/) is a toolkit for creating AI agents that can interact with the Starknet blockchain, supporting multiple AI providers (including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Ollama), and available both as an NPM package and a ready-to-use NestJS server with a web interface.
* [Eliza Starknet plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elizaos/plugin-starknet) bridges Starknet blockchain capabilities with the [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main) ecosystem, enabling both automated and user-directed interactions with the Starknet blockchain, including token operations, trading, portfolio management, and DeFi integrations.
* [Daydreams](https://docs.dreams.fun/) is a generative agent framework for executing tasks across any blockchain or API, enabling AI agents to go beyond simple tasks and achieve complex and long-term objectives such as onchain gaming and DeFi strategies.

## Other tools

* [Open Zeppelin Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/cairo) is a tool that helps you create smart contracts with Open Zeppelin libraries by easily toggling on and off features for popular smart contract patterns.
* [Walnut](https://walnut.dev/) is a transaction debugger and simulator for Starknet that supports Starknet Mainnet, Starknet Sepolia and Starknet Appchains and includes transaction call trace analysis, visual transaction step by step debugger, and transaction simulator.
* [Starknet Devnet JS](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-js) is a JavaScript package that abstracts the Starknet Devnet API, making it easier to interact with it and write end-to-end tests for L1\<>L2 communications.
* [Cairo Playground](https://www.cairo-lang.org/cairovm/) is an online tool that can be used to both experiment with Cairo without deploying a smart contract on Starknet, as well as dive deep into the Cairo virtual machine.
* [Stark Utils](https://www.stark-utils.xyz/converter) is a simple web application that aims to be a toolbox for Cairo developers, allowing you to convert any input to a felt, string, hexadecimal value, and more.
* [Katana](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/katana) is an extremely fast devnet designed to support local development with the [Dojo Starknet gaming engine](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo) but can be used as a general purpose devnet as well.
* [Starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/) is a fast, easy to install, and intuitive command line tool for interacting with Starknet, allowing to query Starknet and make transactions with ease.
* [Universal Sierra Compiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler) is a utility tool for compiling single Sierra files (unlike Scarb, which compiles full projects) from any Sierra version into CASM.
  <Note>
  Universal Sierra Compiler is bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.
  </Note>
* [Cairo Profiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler) is a utility tool that can be used to create profiles of Cairo executions from execution traces, which can be analyzed and used to show flame graphs and other useful information.
  <Note>
  Cairo Profiler is bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.
  </Note>
* [Cairo Lint](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-lint) is a collection of lints that can either be used as either a library or as a standalone binary to help both detect and fix common mistakes and improve your Cairo code.
  <Note>
  Cairo Lint is bundled with Scarb and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.
  </Note>
* [Starknet Contract Verifier](https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet-contract-verifier) is a client for the Voyager Starknet block explorer that allows verifying Starknet contract classes.
  <Note>
  Starknet Contract Verifier is bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.
