toc::[]

== Create a GitHub account
Before you can contribute to Starknet documentation, you must
https://www.github.com/join[sign up for a GitHub account].

== Set up authentication
When you have your account set up, follow the instructions to
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/[generate and set up SSH
keys on GitHub] for proper authentication between your workstation and GitHub.

Confirm authentication is working correctly with the following command:

----
$ ssh -T git@github.com
----

== Fork and clone the Starknet documentation repository

Clone this repo to your local machine. Using a fork is optional.

Set up the Starknet documentation repository on your
workstation so that you can create PRs and contribute. These steps must only
be performed during initial setup.

Using a fork is optional.

. Fork the https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs repository to your
GitHub account from the GitHub UI. You can do this by clicking on *Fork* in the
upper right-hand corner.

. In the terminal on your workstation, change into the directory where you want
to clone the forked repository.

.  Clone the forked repository onto your workstation with the following
command, replacing _<user_name>_ with your actual GitHub username.
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/starknet-docs.git
----

. Change into the directory for the local repository you just cloned.
+
----
$ cd starknet-docs
----

. Add an upstream pointer back to Starknet's remote repository, in this
case _starknet-docs_.
+
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:starknet-io/starknet-docs.git
----

This ensures that you are tracking the remote repository so you can keep your local
repository synchronized.
