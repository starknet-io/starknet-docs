[#how_to_use_this_guide]
== How to use this guide

When looking for style guidance and writing guidance, use these guides in the following order:

[horizontal]
_Starknet documentation supplementary style guide_:: Reference this guide first. It provides guidance that is specific to Starknet documentation. This guidance either supplements or, in specific cases, overrides the other style guides.
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/[_Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation_]:: Provides additional guidance or overrides guidance in the _Google developer documentation style guide_.
link:https://developers.google.com/style[_Google developer documentation style guide_]:: The primary source of style guidance for Starknet documentation.

If you cannot find helpful information or if you must deviate from the guidance in any of these guides, https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs-style-guide/issues[open an issue] for this style guide. The stakeholders can then discuss and determine how to address the issue.

The following reference guides for technical writers provide technical information on AsciiDoc, the markup language we use to author the Starknet technical documentation:

[#titles_and_section_headings]
== Titles and section headings

=== Guidelines for writing headings

* Use sentence case in all titles and section headings. See http://www.titlecase.com/ or https://convertcase.net/ for a conversion tool.
* Be as descriptive as possible with the title or section headings
without making them unnecessarily long.
* For procedural topics, use a gerund form in headings, such as:
** Creating
** Managing
** Using
* For conceptual topic titles, see https://developers.google.com/style/headings[Headings and titles] in the _Google developer documentation style guide_.
* For Reference topic titles, use a title beginning with a noun that describes the content, such as:
** _Compiler command reference_
** The name of a command/programming element, such as `_starknet get_block_`.
** _System calls_
** For more examples, see link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#modular-docs-reference-examples[Reference module examples] in the _Modular documentation reference guide_.

=== Guidelines for headings as structural elements

* Use only one level 1 heading (`=`) in any file.
* For subsequent heading levels, avoid using a single heading for each level. For example, if you have one heading 2 you should add another heading 2.
+
Headings generally separate ideas on a page, so usually a heading indicates a new idea, which logically presupposed a heading for the first idea. Sometimes implementing this guideline requires restructuring the page.

.Example of what to do

* H1: Applying to join the bar
* H2: Pass law school
* H3: Study all day
* H3: Study all night
* H2: Pass the bar exam
* H3: Learn all the laws
* H3: Register for the exam

.Example of what _not_ to do

* H1: Applying to join the bar
* H2: Pass the bar exam //Notice this is the only H2
* H3: Pass law school //Notice this is the only H3
* H4: Study all day
* H4: Study all night
* H4: Learn all the laws
* H4: Register for the exam


== Links to external websites

If you want to link to a third-party website:

* Do not create a hyperlink.
* Use the site top level URL as text.
* Provide the title of the page to search for on the site.

.Example

[source,adoc]
----
For more information, see _A specific page_ at \http://www.example.com/.
----

A hyperlink to a page on a third-party website is convenient and user-friendly _as long as the link works_. The problem is that a third-party site can move pages without notification, in which case that user-friendly link can become a user-unfriendly broken link, and broken links also impact our search engine rankings.

[#glossary]
