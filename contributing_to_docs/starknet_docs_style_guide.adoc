:description: Style guidance for writing Starknet technical documentation

This guide provides style guidelines and preferred term usage for link:https://starknet.io/[the Starknet website], including link:http://docs.starknet.io[docs.starknet.io]. Use it as a supplement to the following style guides:


[#how_to_use_this_guide]
== How to use this guide

When looking for style guidance and writing guidance, use these guides in the following order:

[horizontal]
_Starknet documentation supplementary style guide_:: Reference this guide first. It provides guidance that is specific to Starknet documentation. This guidance either supplements or, in specific cases, overrides the other style guides.
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/[_Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation_]:: Provides additional guidance or overrides guidance in the _Google developer documentation style guide_.
link:https://developers.google.com/style[_Google developer documentation style guide_]:: The primary source of style guidance for Starknet documentation.

If you cannot find helpful information or if you must deviate from the guidance in any of these guides, https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs-style-guide/issues[open an issue] for this style guide. The stakeholders can then discuss and determine how to address the issue.

[[_related_guides]]
== Related guides

The following reference guides for technical writers provide technical information on AsciiDoc, the markup language we use to author the Starknet technical documentation:

[horizontal]
link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[_AsciiDoc Language Documentation_]:: documentation for the AsciiDoc language as itâ€™s implemented in Asciidoctor.
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/asciidoc-markup-conventions/[_AsciiDoc Mark-up Quick Reference_]:: Guidance specific to writing in AsciiDoc. Includes links to complete documentation for AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor.

[#titles_and_section_headings]
== Titles and section headings

=== Guidelines for writing headings

* Use sentence case in all titles and section headings. See http://www.titlecase.com/ or https://convertcase.net/ for a conversion tool.
* Be as descriptive as possible with the title or section headings
without making them unnecessarily long.
* For procedural topics, use a gerund form in headings, such as:
** Creating
** Managing
** Using
* For conceptual topic titles, see https://developers.google.com/style/headings[Headings and titles] in the _Google developer documentation style guide_.
* For Reference topic titles, use a title beginning with a noun that describes the content, such as:
** _Compiler command reference_
** The name of a command/programming element, such as `_starknet get_block_`.
** _System calls_
** For more examples, see link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#modular-docs-reference-examples[Reference module examples] in the _Modular documentation reference guide_.

=== Guidelines for headings as structural elements

* Use only one level 1 heading (`=`) in any file.
* For subsequent heading levels, avoid using a single heading for each level. For example, if you have one heading 2 you should add another heading 2.
+
Headings generally separate ideas on a page, so usually a heading indicates a new idea, which logically presupposed a heading for the first idea. Sometimes implementing this guideline requires restructuring the page.

.Example of what to do

* H1: Applying to join the bar
* H2: Pass law school
* H3: Study all day
* H3: Study all night
* H2: Pass the bar exam
* H3: Learn all the laws
* H3: Register for the exam

.Example of what _not_ to do

* H1: Applying to join the bar
* H2: Pass the bar exam //Notice this is the only H2
* H3: Pass law school //Notice this is the only H3
* H4: Study all day
* H4: Study all night
* H4: Learn all the laws
* H4: Register for the exam


== Links to external websites

If you want to link to a third-party website:

* Do not create a hyperlink.
* Use the site top level URL as text.
* Provide the title of the page to search for on the site.

.Example

[source,adoc]
----
For more information, see _A specific page_ at \http://www.example.com/.
----

A hyperlink to a page on a third-party website is convenient and user-friendly _as long as the link works_. The problem is that a third-party site can move pages without notification, in which case that user-friendly link can become a user-unfriendly broken link, and broken links also impact our search engine rankings.

[#glossary]
