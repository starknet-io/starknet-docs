= Documentation guidelines
// include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc
:toc: macro


// These guidelines are based on the guidelines for OpenShift documentation. Some sections of the original documentation are commented out. In the future, once it is determined they are not relevant to Starknet docs, those sections might be removed.

== Style guidance and writing guidance

All Starknet documentation should conform to the same rules and guidelines. See the xref:starknet_docs_style_guide.adoc[Starknet documentation style guide].

The rest of this topic details the modular structure and AsciiDoc / Antora requirements and conventions for building Starknet documentation.

toc::[]

== Adding files to the collection

When you create new files, you must add them to the `components/Starknet/modules/<module>/nav*.adoc` file so that the build system can render them in the table of contents.

For possible values of `<module>`, see the directories under `/components/Starknet/modules/`.

If you don't include the file in the `nav*.adoc` file, Antora includes the file in the built output, but it is not accessible via the TOC.

== Structuring information

The documentation guidelines for Starknet build on top of the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/[_Red Hat modular docs reference guide_]. However, because Antora does not natively account for assemblies, Starknet documentation does not use assemblies, so when reading this guide, focus on the information related to modularizing content based on the three major information types:

* _Conceptual_
* _Procedural_
* _Reference_

== Style guidance

These _Documentation guidelines_ are primarily concerned with the modular structure and AsciiDoc / Antora requirements for building Starknet documentation. For style guidance, use these style guides in the following order:

. xref:starknet_docs_style_guide.adoc[_Starknet documentation style guide_] Reference this guide first. It provides guidance that is specific to Starknet documentation.
. link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide[_Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation_]. This guide overrides certain guidance from the _Google developer documentation style guide_.
. link:https://developers.google.com/style[_Google developer documentation style guide_]

If you cannot find helpful information or if you must deviate from the guidance in any of these guides, open an issue in the https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs-style-guide/issues[Starknet documentation style guide repo]. The stakeholders can then discuss and determine if and how to address the issue.

toc::[]

== General text editor guidelines

* Set your editor to strip trailing whitespace.
* The end of each file should have an empty line.
// * Do *not* hard wrap lines at 80 characters (or at any other length).
// +
// It is not necessary to update existing content to unwrap lines, but you can remove existing hard wrapping from any lines that you are currently working in.

[id="topic-file-metadata"]
== Topic metadata

Every topic should be placed in a logical directory under `/components/StarkNet/modules` with the following metadata at the top of the file:

----
[id="<topic-anchor>_{context}"]                                   <1>
= Topic title                                                      <2>
----

<1> A topic anchor with `{context}` that must be lowercase and must match the topic's file name.
<2> Human readable title. To ensure consistency in the results of the
leveloffset values in include statements, you must use a level one heading
( = ) for the topic title.

Example:

----

[id="cli-basic-commands_{context}"]
= Basic CLI commands
----

== Conditional text
Starknet documentation uses AsciiDoc's `ifdef/endif` macro to conditionalize and reuse content, down to the single-line level.

For information on conditionalization in AsciiDoc, see link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals[Conditionals] in the _AsciiDoc Language Documentation_.

For example, if the same file should appear in _Document A_ and _Document B_, with only minor differences:
----
This first line is unconditionalized, and will appear in both _Document A_ and _Document B_.

\ifdef::document_A[]
This line will only appear for _Document A_.
\endif::document_A[]

ifdef::document_B
This line will only appear for _Document B_.
\endif::document_B[]

ifndef::document_B
This line will not appear for _Document B_.
\endif::[]
----

[NOTE]
====
While the `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, do not use them to
conditionalize an entire file. If an entire file is specific to
only some distributions, specify them in the `nav.adoc`
file.
====

[id="snippet-file-metadata"]
== Text snippet file metadata
Every text snippet should be placed in the `partials` folder for the topic in which they are used, and should contain the following metadata at the top:

[source,adoc]
----
// Text snippet included in the following files: <1>
//
// * list of files where this text snippet is included
----

<1> List of topics in which this text snippet is included.

[NOTE]
====
An anchor ID and human readable title are not required metadata. This type of component is text only and not intended to be published or cross referenced on its own. See <<writing-text-snippets>>.
====

.Example:

[source,adoc]
----
// Text snippet included in the following files:
//
// * getting_started/pages/account_setup.adoc
// * getting_started/pages/deploying_contracts.adoc

[NOTE]
====
Starknet accounts are smart contracts. As such, creating one involves sending a transaction, and takes a bit longer than creating an EOA on other networks.
You can learn more in https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/introduction/[What is an account?].
====
----

[id="attribute-files"]
== Attribute files

[quote,AsciiDoc Language Documentation]
____
Document attributes are effectively document-scoped variables for the AsciiDoc language. The AsciiDoc language defines a set of built-in attributes, and also allows the author (or extensions) to define additional document attributes, which may replace built-in attributes when permitted.
____

For detailed information on attributes in AsciiDocs, see link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/document-attributes/[Document Attributes] in the _AsciiDoc Language Documentation_.

If an attribute is used in multiple files, it is helpful to place those attributes in a single attributes file, and use an `include` statement to import those attributes where relevant. The attribute file is a normal AsciiDoc file.

All attribute files must be placed in the `partials` directory for the primary topic that uses them. Reference an attributes file using the following syntax:

 include::partial$attributes/<file_name>.adoc[]

For example:

 include::partial$attributes/attributes.adoc[]

If files in more than one topic reference the same attribute file, use the following syntax, or suggest a new strategy in a Github issue:

. Create a symlink to the attributes file in the `partials` directory of the parent module for the file that includes the attributes file.

For example: Consider the following files:

* Attributes file: `/components/Starknet/modules/ROOT/partials/attributes.adoc`
* Content file: `/components/Starknet/modules/useful_info/pages/audit.adoc`

To include `attributes.adoc` in `audit.adoc`:

 include::$ROOT:partial$attributes.adoc[]


== File names

Try to shorten the file name as much as possible _without_ abbreviating important terms that might cause confusion. For example, the `managing-authorization-policies.adoc` file name would be appropriate for a topic entitled _Managing Authorization Policies_.

== Directory names

If you create a directory with a multiple-word name, separate each word with an underscore, for example `backup_and_restore`.

Do not create or rename a top-level directory in the repository and topic map without checking with the docs team first.

// [TIP]
// ====
// To create the symbolic links:
//
// . Navigate to the directory that you need to add the links in.
// . Use the following command to create a symbolic link:
// +
// ----
// $ ln -s <target_directory> <link_name>
// ----
// +
// For example, if you are creating the links in a directory that is two levels deep, such as `cli_reference/cli`, use the following commands:
// +
// ----
// $ ln -s ../../images/ images
// $ ln -s ../../modules/ modules
// $ ln -s ../../snippets/ snippets
// $ ln -s ../../_attributes/ attributes
// ----
// +
// Be sure to adjust the number of levels to back up (`../`) depending on how deep your directory is.
//
// If you accidentally create an incorrect link, you can remove that link by using `unlink <link_name>`.
// ====

== Discrete headings

If you have a section heading that you do not want to appear in the TOC, for example, if you think that some section is not worth showing up or if there are already too many nested levels, you can use a discrete heading:

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/discrete-headings/

To use a discrete heading, just add `[discrete]` to the line before your unique ID. For example:

----
[discrete]
[id="managing-authorization-policies_{context}"]
== Managing authorization policies
----

== Anchoring titles and section headings

All titles and section headings must have an anchor ID. The anchor ID must be similar to the title or section heading.

You must add the `{context}` variable to the end of each anchor ID in topic files. When called, the `{context}` variable is resolved into the value declared in the `:context:` attribute in the corresponding section of the document. This enables cross-referencing to topic IDs in context when a topic is included in multiple locations.

[NOTE]
====
The `{context}` variable must be preceded by an underscore (`_`) when declared in an anchor ID.
====

The following is an example of an anchor ID for a topic file title:

----
[id="sending-notifications-to-external-systems_{context}"]
= Sending notifications to external systems
----

The following is an example of an anchor ID for a second level (`==`) heading:

----
[id="deployment-scaling-benefits_{context}"]
== Deployment and scaling benefits
----

== Writing concepts
A _concept_ contains information to support the tasks that users want to do and
must not include task information like commands or numbered steps.

Avoid using gerunds in concept titles. "About <concept>"
is a common concept topic title.

For more information about creating concept topics, see the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-concept-modules[_Red Hat modular docs reference guide_] and the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_concept-explanation.adoc[concept template].

== Writing procedural topics
A _procedure_ contains the steps that users follow to complete a process or task. Procedures contain ordered steps and explicit commands.

Use a gerund in the procedure title, such as "Creating".

For more information about writing procedural topics, see the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-procedure-modules[_Red Hat modular docs reference guide_] and the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing-one-procedure.adoc[procedure template].

[id="writing-text-snippets"]
== Writing text snippets
A _text snippet_ is an optional component that lets you reuse content in multiple topics. Text snippets are not a substitute for topics but instead are a more granular form of content reuse.

While a topic is content that a reader can understand on its own (like an article) or as part of a larger body of work (like a guide), a text snippet is not self-contained and is not intended to be published or cross referenced on its own.

Examples include the following:

* Admonitions that appear in multiple locations.
* An introductory paragraph that appears in multiple locations.
* The same series of steps that appear in multiple procedural topics.
* A deprecation statement that appears in multiple sets of release notes.

Example:

You could write the following paragraph once and include it in each location that explains how to install a cluster using the installer-provisioned default values:

[source,adoc]
----
In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on {cloud-provider-first} ({cloud-provider}) that uses the default configuration options.
----

For more information about creating text snippets, see the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#using-text-snippets[_Red Hat modular docs reference guide_].

// == IP addresses
//
// You can include IPv4 addresses from test clusters in examples in the documentation, as long as they are private. Private IPv4 addresses fall into one of the following ranges:
//
// * 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (class A address block 10.0.0.0/8)
// * 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (class B address block 172.16.0.0/12)
// * 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (class C address block 192.168.0.0/16)
//
// Replace all public IP addresses with an address from the following blocks. These address blocks are reserved for documentation:
//
// * 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 (TEST-NET-1 address block 192.0.2.0/24)
// * 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255 (TEST-NET-2 address block 198.51.100.0/24)
// * 203.0.113.0 to 203.0.113.255 (TEST-NET-3 address block 203.0.113.0/24)
//
// [NOTE]
// ====
// There might be advanced networking examples that require specific IP addresses, or cloud provider-specific examples that require a public IP address. Contact a subject matter expert if you need assistance with replacing IP addresses.
// ====

=== Example URLs
To provide an example URL path that you do not want to render as a hyperlink, use this format:

....
`\https://www.example.com`
....

== Embedding a local source code file

You can embed local source code files in AsciiDoc topics.

Use the `include` directive to target the local file.

To use a local source code file, add it to the `/<module>/attachments/` directory, and include it in your module. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
\include::attachment$install-config.yml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Do not include link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-lines/[lines by content ranges]. This approach can lead to content errors when the included file is subsequently updated.
====

[discrete]
=== Using AsciiDoc callouts in the source code

You can use AsciiDoc callouts in the source code file.
Comment out the callout in the YAML file to ensure that file can still be parsed as valid YAML.
Asciidoctor recognizes the commented callout and renders it correctly in the output.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1 # <1>
----

// == Indicating Technology Preview features
//
// To indicate that a feature is in Technology Preview, include the `snippets/technology-preview.adoc` file in the feature's assembly or module to keep the supportability wording consistent across Technology Preview features. Provide a value for the `:FeatureName:` variable before you include this module.
//
// [source,text]
// ----
// :FeatureName: The XYZ plug-in
// \include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]
// ----
//
// == Indicating deprecated features
//
// To indicate that a feature is deprecated, include the `modules/deprecated-feature.adoc` file in the feature's assembly, or to each relevant assembly such as for a deprecated Operator, to keep the supportability wording consistent across deprecated features. Provide a value for the `:FeatureName:` variable before you include this module.


== Verification of your content

All documentation changes must be verified by a subject matter expert before merging. This includes executing all procedure changes and confirming expected results. There are exceptions for typo-level changes, formatting-only changes, and other negotiated documentation sets and distributions.

// If a documentation change is due to a bug report or Jira issue, the bug/issue should be put on ON_QA when you have a PR ready. After QE approval is given (either in the bug/issue or in the PR), the QE associate should move the bug/issue status to VERIFIED, at which point the associated PR can be merged. It is also ok for the assigned writer to change the status of the bug/issue to VERIFIED if approval for the changes has been provided in another forum (slack, PR, or email). The writer should indicate that the QE team approved the change as a comment in the bug/issue.

== Images

=== Image format

Use `*.png` format images.

=== Block images

To include a block image (an image on its own line):

1. Put the image file in the `modules/<module>/images` folder.
// +
// Ensure that the folder containing your assembly contains an `images` symbolic link to the top-level `images/` directory, otherwise the image will not be found when building the docs.

2. In the `.adoc` content, use this format to link to the image:
+
----
image::<module>:<image_filename>[<alt_text>]
----
+
Notice the double `::` instead of a single `:`, as seen in inline image usage.
+
.Example
[source,adoc]
----
image::documentation:architecture_and_concepts:l1l2.png[L1 to L2 messaging]
----
+
The image file, `l1l2.png`, is in `modules/architecture_and_concepts/images/`.

=== Inline images


Use this formatting:

----
image:<module>:<image_filename>[<alt_text>]
----

Note the single `:` instead of a double `::`, as seen in block image usage.

For example:

----
image:documentation:architecture_and_concepts:manage-columns.png[title="Manage Columns icon"]
----

== Formatting

For all of the system blocks including table delimiters, use four characters. For example:

....
|=== for tables
---- for code blocks
....

[NOTE]
====
You can use backticks or other markup in the title for a block, such as a code block `.Example` or a table `.Description` title.
====

=== Code blocks, command syntax, and example output

Code blocks generally show examples of command syntax, example
screen output, and configuration files.

The main distinction between showing command syntax and a command example is
that a command syntax shows readers how to use the command without real values.
An example command, however, shows the command with actual values with an
example output of that command, where applicable.

For example:

....
Run the following command to initialize an account:

[source,terminal]
----
starknet new_account --account <account_name>
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Account address: 0x04e93e1fb507d23b398f0a09f5873d3a7769b0e7ed40dbbe8fe7a2e8ea831006
Public key: 0x07a328511fa8552cd61aaaa89076fe40c3566f4594f29324aa754d41d7c7c55e
Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account
by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command.

NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed
differently.
----
....

This renders as:

> Run the following command to initialize an account:
>
> ----
>starknet new_account --account <account_name>
> ----
>
> .Example output
> ----
> Account address: 0x04e93e1fb507d23b398f0a09f5873d3a7769b0e7ed40dbbe8fe7a2e8ea831006
> Public key: 0x07a328511fa8552cd61aaaa89076fe40c3566f4594f29324aa754d41d7c7c55e
> Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account
> by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command.
>
> NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed
differently.
> ----

The following guidelines go into more detail about specific requirements and
recommendations when using code blocks:

* If a step in a procedure is to run a command, make sure that the step
text includes an explicit instruction to "run" or "enter" the command. In most cases,
use one of the following patterns to introduce the code block:

** <Step description> by running the following command:
** <Step description> by entering the following command:
** <Step description>, run the following command:
** <Step description>, enter the following command:

* Any example of command line input must begin with a prompt, as follows:
** A terminal prompt for a normal user should begin with a dollar sign (`$`) prompt:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ <regular_user_permission_command_line_input>
----
** A terminal prompt for a superuser should begin with a hash symbol (`#`) prompt:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# <superuser_permission_command_line_input>
----
** A terminal prompt for a command in a non-standard shell, such as a Docker shell, should use the prompt of that shell. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
root@17617744386d:/app# ./player.py
----
* Avoid using markup in the code block. If you must use any markup in code blocks, see the Asciidoctor documentation on source blocks and substitutions:
** link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/verbatim/source-blocks/[Source Code Blocks]
** link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/subs/[Substitutions]
+
[CAUTIONI]
====
It can take some trial and error to figure out the correct source block macro to use for the exact markup you want to use.
====

* For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block (unless
that line is introducing block metadata, such as `[source,terminal]` for syntax
highlighting).
+
Acceptable:
+
....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....
+
Not acceptable:
+
....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....
+
Without the line spaces, the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

* Use `[source,terminal]` for CLI commands, and any other commands that you enter in the terminal, to enable
syntax highlighting. Any `[source]` metadata must go on the line directly before
the code block. For example:
+
....
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
....
+
If you are also showing a code block for the output of the command, use
`[source,terminal]` for that code block as well.

* Use source tags for the programming language used in the code block to enable
syntax highlighting. For example:

** `[source,cairo]`
** `[source,python]`
** `[source,javascript]`
** `[source,json]`

// * Do not use more than one command per code block. For example, the following must
// be split up into three separate code blocks:
// +
// ....
// To create templates you can modify, run the following commands:
//
// [source,terminal]
// ----
// $ oc adm create-login-template > login.html
// ----
//
// [source,terminal]
// ----
// $ oc adm create-provider-selection-template > providers.html
// ----
//
// [source,terminal]
// ----
// $ oc adm create-error-template > errors.html
// ----
// ....

* If your command contains multiple lines and uses callout annotations, you must comment out the callout(s) in the codeblock, as shown in the following example:
+
....
To scale based on the percent of CPU utilization, create a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` object for an existing object:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc autoscale <object_type>/<name> \// <1>
  --min <number> \// <2>
  --max <number> \// <3>
  --cpu-percent=<percent> <4>
----
<1> Specify the type and name of the object to autoscale.
<2> Optional: Specify the minimum number of replicas when scaling down.
<3> Specify the maximum number of replicas when scaling up.
<4> Specify the target average CPU utilization over all the pods, represented as a percent of requested CPU.
....

* Separate a command and its related example output into individual code blocks.
This enables a reader to easily copy the command using the *Copy* button image:images/clippy.png[alt="Copy",20,20] on
docs.starknet.io.
+
In addition, prepend the code block for the output with the title `.Example output`
to make it consistently clear across the docs when this is being represented. A
lead-in sentence explaining the example output is optional. For example:
+
....
Run the `starknet new_account` command to initialize an account:

[source,terminal]
----
$ starknet new_account --account <account_name>
----

The output verifies that a new account was initialized:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Account address: 0x04e93e1fb507d23b398f0a09f5873d3a7769b0e7ed40dbbe8fe7a2e8ea831006
Public key: 0x07a328511fa8552cd61aaaa89076fe40c3566f4594f29324aa754d41d7c7c55e
Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account
by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command.

NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed
differently.
----
....

* To mark up command syntax, use the code block and wrap any replaceable values in angle brackets (`<>`) with the required command parameter, using underscores (`_`) between words as necessary for legibility. For example:
+
....
To deploy the account you initialized, now run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ starknet deploy_account --account=<account_name>
----
....
+
This renders as:
+
--
> To deploy the account you initialized, now run the following command:

> ----
> $ starknet deploy_account --account=<account_name>
> ----
--

* When referring to a path to a location that the user has selected or created, treat the part of the path that the user chose as a replaceable value. For example:
+
....
Create a secret that contains the certificate and key in the namespace:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret tls <certificate> --cert=<path_to_certificate>/cert.crt
----
....
+
This renders as:
+
--
> Create a secret that contains the certificate and key in the namespace:
>
> ----
> $ oc create secret tls <certificate> --cert=<path_to_certificate>/cert.crt
> ----
--
* If you must provide additional information on what a line of a code block
represents, you can use callouts (`<1>`, `<2>`, etc.) to provide that information.
+
Use this format when embedding callouts into the code block:
+
[subs=-callouts]
....
----
code example 1 <1>
code example 2 <2>
----
<1> A note about the first example value.
<2> A note about the second example value.
....

* If you must provide additional information on what a line of a code block
represents and the use of callouts is impractical, you can use a description list
to provide information about the variables in the code block. Using callouts
might be impractical if a code block contains too many conditional statements to
easily use numbered callouts or if the same note applies to multiple lines of the codeblock.
+
[source,adoc]
....
----
code <variable_1>
code <variable_2>
----
+
where:

[horizontal]
<variable_1>:: Specifies the explanation of the first variable.
<variable_2>:: Specifies the explanation of the first variable.
....
+
Be sure to introduce the description list with "where:" and start each variable
description with "Specifies."

* For long lines of code that you want to break up among multiple lines, use a
backslash to show the line break. For example:
+
----
$ oc get endpoints --all-namespaces --template \
    '{{ range .items }}{{ .metadata.namespace }}:{{ .metadata.name }} \
    {{ range .subsets }}{{ range .addresses }}{{ .ip }} \
    {{ end }}{{ end }}{{ "\n" }}{{ end }}' | awk '/ 172\.30\./ { print $1 }'
----

* For snippets or sections of a file, use an ellipsis (`...` or `# ...` for YAML) to show that the file continues before or after the quoted block.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    test: liveness
# ...
----
+
Do not use `[...]`, `<snip>`, or any other variant.

=== Inline code or commands
Do NOT show full commands or command syntax inline within a sentence. The next section covers how to show commands and command syntax.

The only use case for inline commands would be general commands and operations, without replaceables and command options. In this case use back ticks to indicate an inline command. For example:

....
Use the `GET` operation to do x.
....

This renders as:

> Use the `GET` operation to do x.

=== System messages

System messages include error, warning, confirmation, and information messages.

If a message is short enough to include inline, enclose it in back ticks:

....
Previously, image builds and pushes would fail with the `error reading blob from source` error message because the builder logic would compute the contents of new layers twice.
....

This renders as:

> Previously, image builds and pushes would fail with the `error reading blob from source` error message because the builder logic would compute the contents of new layers twice.

If a message is too long to include inline, put it inside a code block with `[source,text]` metadata:

....
Previously, the AWS Terraform provider that the installation program used occasionally caused a race condition with the S3 bucket, and the cluster installation failed with the following error message:

NOTE: Always refer to a message with the type of message it is, followed by the word _message_. For example, refer to an error message as an _error message_, and not simply as an _error_.

=== Lists
Write numbered lists as shown in this example:

....
. Item 1 (2 spaces between the period and the first character)

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as:

> . Item 1
> . Item 2
> . Item 3

If you must add any text, admonitions, or code blocks you have to add the `+` below the line to indicate continuation. For example:

....
. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as:

> . Item 1
> +
> ----
> some code block
> ----
> . Item 2
> . Item 3

=== Footnotes

Avoid footnotes when possible.

If you reference a footnote from only a single location, use the following syntax:

.Footnote
....
footnote:[This is the footnote text.]
....

If you reference a footnote from multiple locations, set an attribute with the footnote text. As a consequence, this will duplicate the footnote text at bottom of the page.

.Footnote with text set by an attribute
....
:note-text: This is a footnote.

This text has a footnote qualifier attached footnote:[{note-text}].

But this other text uses the same qualifier elsewhere footnote:[{note-text}].
....

[id="collapsible-content"]
=== Collapsible content
You can collapse sections of content by using the `collapsible` option, which converts the Asciidoctor markup to HTML `details` and `summary` sections. The `collapsible` option is used at the writer's discretion and is appropriate for considerably long code blocks, lists, or other such content that significantly increases the length of a topic.

[NOTE]
====
You must set a title for the `summary` section. If a title is not set, the default title is "Details."
====

Collapsible content is formatted as shown:

....
.Title of the `summary` dropdown
[%collapsible]
====
This is content within the `details` section.
====
....

This renders as a dropdown with collapsed content:

.Title of the `Summary` dropdown
[%collapsible]
====
This is content within the `Details` section.
====

If your collapsible content includes an admonition such as a note or warning, you must nest the admonition:

....
.Collapsible content that includes an admonition
[%collapsible]
====
This content includes an admonition.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami
----

[NOTE]
=====
Nest admonitions when using the `collapsible` option.
=====
====
....

This renders as:

.Collapsible content that includes an admonition
[%collapsible]
====
This content includes an admonition.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami
----

[NOTE]
=====
Nest admonitions when using the `collapsible` option.

=== Additional resources sections

The following guidelines apply to all "Additional resources" sections:

* Avoid including paragraphs in the section. Use an unordered list.
* The links and xrefs in the unordered list must contain human-readable text between the square brackets.
* Each item in the unordered list must contain a minimum of text besides the link or xref.
* Use `.Additional resources` formatting for an Additional resources section when it applies to a section within a topic. For example:
+
[source,adoc]
----
.Additional resources
----
* Use `==` formatting for the section heading (`== Additional resources`) when it applies to the entire topic. For example:
+
----
[id="additional-resources_configuring-alert-notifications"]
== Additional resources

* link:some-url.com[Human readable label]
* xref:some_xref[Human readable label]
* xref:some_other_xref[Human readable label]
----

== Admonitions (Notes, Tips, Cautions...)
Format admonitions, such as notes and warnings, as follows:

....
[ADMONITION]
====
Text for admonition
====
....

For a list of available admonition types, see link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/#admonitions[Admonitions] in the _Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation_.

[#peer_review]
== Peer reviews

* Easy fixes: For simple fixes such as fixing typos, any writer with merge permissions can go ahead and merge those fixes without any review.

* New features: When documenting new features or significant changes to existing functionality, you must have a peer review prior to merging.

* Outdated content that should be updated as quickly as possible: You should get a peer review, but if the assigned reviewer does not review it within ~48 hours, then you can merge it with technical updates and follow up with the peer review as soon as possible.
