= Developer tools

To support its unique architecture, Starknet boasts its own suite of developer tools that aim to streamline the development process for Starknet developers. While sometimes developed in coordination with StarkWare, the majority of these tools are community-driven projects, showcasing the collaborative and innovative spirit of the Starknet ecosystem.

The following are Starknet's key developer tools:

* AI tools:
** https://www.cairo-coder.com/[Cairo Coder^] is an intelligent code generation service that uses advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to understand Cairo's syntax, patterns, and best practices, and provide high-quality, functional Cairo code based on natural language descriptions.
** https://agent.starknet.io/[Starknet Agent^], an AI-powered search engine that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to search and understand the Starknet documentation, Cairo Book, and other resources and provide clear and accurate answers to any queries.
** https://www.starkagent.ai/[Snak^] is a toolkit for creating AI agents that can interact with the Starknet blockchain, supporting multiple AI providers (including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Ollama), and available both as an NPM package and a ready-to-use NestJS server with a web interface.
