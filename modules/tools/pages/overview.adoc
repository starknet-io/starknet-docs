= Tooling overview

To support its unique architecture, Starknet boasts its own suite of developer tools that aim to streamline the development process for Starknet developers. While sometimes developed in coordination with StarkWare, the majority of these tools are community-driven projects, showcasing the collaborative and innovative spirit of the Starknet ecosystem.

Starknet's core tools include:

* https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/[Scarb^], the build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet
* https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/[Starknet Foundry], the toolchain for developing Starknet smart contracts
* https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet/[Starknet Devnet^], a local testnet for Starknet
* The various Starknet software development kits:
https://starknetjs.com/[starknet.js^],
https://starknetpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[starknet.py^],
https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starknet-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#starknet-rs[starknet-rs^],
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/NethermindEth/starknet.go#section-readme[starknet.go^],
https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet-jvm?tab=readme-ov-file#-starknet-jvm-[starknet-jvm^],
https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.swift?tab=readme-ov-file#starknetswift[starknet.swift^],
and https://starknetdart.dev/[starknet.dart^]

.Tools for coding in Cairo

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1[VS Code Cairo extension^] is an extension for the Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) Code IDE that provides assistance when writing Cairo smart contracts, including live diagnostic highlighting for compile errors, quick fixes with suggestions, code formatting and completion, and more.

* https://www.cairo-lang.org/cairovm/[Cairo Playground^] is an online tool that can be used to both experiment with Cairo without deploying a smart contract on Starknet, as well as dive deep into the Cairo virtual machine.

* https://github.com/FuzzingLabs/sierra-analyzer[Sierra Analyzer^] is a security toolkit for analyzing Sierra files, including decompiling a Sierra file, printing the contract's control flow graph, and running static analysis detectors.

* https://www.stark-utils.xyz/converter[Stark Utils^] is a simple web application that aims to be a toolbox for Cairo developers, allowing you to convert any input to a felt, string, hexadecimal value, and more.

* https://github.com/FuzzingLabs/thoth[Thoth^] is a Cairo security toolkit that includes analyzers, disassemblers, and decompilers, which enable the generation of call, control-flow, and data-flow graphs for Sierra and Casm files, as well as other advanced tools, such as a symbolic execution engine and a symbolic bounded model checker.

* https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler[Universal Sierra Compiler^] is a utility tool for compiling single Sierra files (unlike Scarb, which compiles full projects) from any Sierra version into CASM.

* https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler[Cairo Profiler^] is a utility tool that can be used to create profiles of Cairo executions from execution traces, which can be analyzed and used to show flame graphs and other useful information.

* https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-lint[Cairo Lint^] is a collection of lints that can either be used as either a library or as a standalone binary to help both detect and fix common mistakes and improve your Cairo code.

[NOTE]
====
Universal Sierra Compiler and Cairo Profiler comes bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.

Cairo Lint comes bundled with Scarb and does not need to be installed separately if Scarb is installed.
