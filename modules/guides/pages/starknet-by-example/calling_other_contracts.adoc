== Calling Other Contracts

In Starknet, contracts can interact with each other through contract
calls. The recommended way to make these calls is using the dispatcher
pattern, which provides type safety and better error handling.

=== Understanding Dispatchers

A dispatcher is an automatically generated struct that handles the
serialization and deserialization of contract calls. To use dispatchers:

[arabic]
. Define the target contract’s interface as a trait with
`#++[++starknet::interface++]++` (`IContract`)
. Import the generated dispatcher types (`IContractDispatcher` and
`IContractDispatcherTrait`)
. Create a dispatcher instance with the target contract’s address

Let’s look at a practical example where one contract (`Caller`)
interacts with another (`Callee`). The `Callee` contract stores a value
that can be set and retrieved:

[source,cairo]
----
// [!include ~/listings/getting-started/calling_other_contracts/src/caller.cairo:callee_contract]
----

The `Caller` contract demonstrates how to use the dispatcher to interact
with `Callee`:

[source,cairo]
----
// [!include ~/listings/getting-started/calling_other_contracts/src/caller.cairo:caller_contract]
----

==== Key Points:

* The `#++[++starknet::interface++]++` attribute automatically generates
the dispatcher types
* Dispatchers handle all the low-level details of contract interaction
* Contract calls are type-safe and checked at compile time
* Each contract maintains its own storage and state

Book].

[NOTE]
====
While you can use the low-level `call++_++contract++_++syscall`
directly, it’s not recommended as it:

* Requires manual serialization/deserialization
* Lacks compile-time type checking
* Is more easy to make mistakes
