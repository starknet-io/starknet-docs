= Setting up your Starknet development environment

include::partial$snippet-important-troubleshooting.adoc[]

== Introduction

Welcome to the first installment of the _Deploy your first Starknet contract_ guide! ğŸ¥‡

As a popular phrase (often attributed to Abraham Lincoln) says, "Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe". The first installment of the series will therefore guide you through setting up your development environment, which will include the three most recommended tools to begin developing on Starknet:

* _Scarb_, a build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet ecosystems

* _Starknet Foundry_, the go-to framework for building and testing Starknet Smart Contracts

* _Starknet Devnet_, a Rust implementation of a local Starknet node

[TIP]

To review these tools in more detail, as well as all other Starknet developer tools, check out the xref:tools:overview.adoc[Tooling section].

== Setting up your environment on MacOS and Linux

=== Installing Scarb and Starknet Foundry


On MacOS and Linux, Scarb and Starknet Foundry can be easily installed using the https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup[Starkup installer^] by running:

[source,terminal]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
----

and following the onscreen instructions. You can verify that Scarb and Starknet Foundry are installed correctly by running:

[source,terminal]
----
scarb --version
snforge --version && sncast --version
----

If the installation was successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
scarb 2.11.4 (c0ef5ec6a 2025-04-09)
cairo: 2.11.4 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.11.4)
sierra: 1.7.0

snforge 0.42.0
sncast 0.42.0
----

[NOTE]
====
Starkup installs Scarb and Starknet Foundry Devnet on MacOS and Linux via the https://asdf-vm.com/[`asdf` version manager^], which allows to easily switch between their different versions, both globally and per project (see full details in the https://asdf-vm.com/manage/commands.html[`asdf` documentation^] or by running `asdf --help`). Alongside Scarb and Starknet Foundry, Starkup uses `asdf` to install additional useful tools, including the https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler[Universal Sierra Compiler^], https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler[Cairo Profiler^], https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage[Cairo Coverage^], and https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols[CairoLS^].

If you encounter any issues while using it or have any requests, please help by https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup/issues/new[submitting an issue^].

=== Installing Starknet Devnet

xref:#installing-scarb-and-snfoundry[Similar to Scarb and Starknet Foundry], it is highly recommended to install Starknet Devnet on MacOS and Linux via the `asdf` version manager. Luckily, if you installed Scarb and Starknet Foundry using the Starkup installer, you should already have `asdf` installed. To install Starknet Devnet using `asdf`:

. Verify that `asdf` is installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf --version
----
+
or install it by following the instructions in the link:https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html[`asdf` documentation].

. Install the `asdf` Starknet Devnet plugin:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
----

. Install the latest version of Starknet Devnet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf install starknet-devnet latest
----

. Set global version for Starknet Devnet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf set -u starknet-devnet latest
----

. Restart the terminal and verify that Starknet Devnet is installed correctly:
+
[source,terminal]
----
starknet-devnet --version
----

If the installation was successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
starknet-devnet 0.4.1
----

== Setting up your environment on Windows

Setting up Scarb and Starknet Foundry on Windows requires configuring the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and installing the tools inside a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.

=== Installing WSL and Ubuntu

. Open PowerShell as administrator and run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
wsl --install
----
+
This command installs WSL along with the default Ubuntu distribution. If WSL or virtualization is not yet enabled, reboot and re-run the command as needed.

. Restart your computer when prompted.

. After reboot, launch Ubuntu from the Start menu. On the first launch, create a UNIX username and password when prompted.

[NOTE]
====
If `wsl --install` does not work, enable WSL manually by running:

[source,terminal]
----
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
----

and installing Ubuntu from the https://aka.ms/wslstore[Microsoft Store^].
====

=== Installing prerequisites in Ubuntu

. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential
----

=== Installing Homebrew

. Run the Homebrew install script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

. Add Homebrew to your shell environment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
----

. Verify that Homebrew was installed correctly:
+
[source,terminal]
----
brew --version
----

=== Installing `asdf`

[NOTE]
====
Using `asdf` allows you to easily switch between versions of Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet globally or per project.
====

. Install `asdf` using Homebrew:
+
[source,terminal]
----
brew install asdf
----

. Add `asdf` to your shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
echo '. "$(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
----

. Verify that `asdf` is installed correctly:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf --version
----

=== Installing Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet

. Add the Scarb plugin and install the latest Scarb version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf plugin add scarb
asdf install scarb latest
asdf set -u scarb latest
----

. Add the Starknet Foundry plugin and install the latest Starknet Foundry version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
asdf install starknet-foundry latest
asdf set -u starknet-foundry latest
----

. Add the Starknet Devnet plugin and install the latest Starknet Devnet version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
asdf install starknet-devnet latest
asdf set -u starknet-devnet latest
----

. Restart your terminal and verify that Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet were installed correctly:
+
[source,terminal]
----
scarb --version
snforge --version && sncast --version
starknet-devnet --version
----
+
[TIP]
====
If `scarb`, `snforge`, or `starknet-devnet` are not recognized, try running `source ~/.bashrc` or restarting your terminal.
