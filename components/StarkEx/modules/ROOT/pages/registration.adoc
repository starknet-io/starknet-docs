= Registration (v1.0)


image::registration.png[]

In StarkEx, Registration means mapping the user  xref:starkex-specific-concepts.adoc#starkkey[`starkKey`] to his Ethereum Address. This mapping enforces that when funds are removed from an L2 account, only the Ethereum address registered to that account's `starkKey` will be able to withdraw the funds on-chain.
[NOTE]
====
In StarkEx for Perpetual Trading v2.0, registration is not required for user onboarding. The mapping between the `starkKey` and the Ethereum address happens in the xref:v2.0.adoc[withdrawal] flow by requiring the user to specify a destination Ethereum address. This flow has changed due to the effort to reduce gas costs for users.

[id="step_1_off_chain_registration_request"]
== Step 1: Off-Chain Registration Request

Alice requests the application operator to register her `starkKey` under her Ethereum address. If the application chooses to register Alice (each application can have its own registration policy), it signs the mapping with the `userAdmin` key.
[NOTE]
====
Any number of `starkKeys` can be mapped to the same Ethereum address.
====

[id="step_2_on_chain_registration_transaction"]
== Step 2: On-Chain Registration Transaction

A transaction is sent to the StarkEx contract, containing the Ethereum address, the `starkKey` and the signature obtained during the previous step. See  xref:public-interactions.adoc#registration[register] for more information on this function.
[NOTE]
====
On-chain registration can be done by any Ethereum address. For example, the application may choose to do the on-chain registration, obscuring this step from the user. +
Note that this operation cannot be harmful to the users in any way.
