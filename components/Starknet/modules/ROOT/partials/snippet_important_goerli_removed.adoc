.Goerli testnet support is now removed.

Originally, Goerli testnet was scheduled to be removed April 11, 2024, however, following the recent mass exit of Ethereum Goerli validators and the current inactivity of Starknet Goerli, Starknet Goerli testnet is now shut down, to avoid maintaining an inactive network.

Sepolia testnet replaces Goerli testnet.

For more information, including bridge support for Sepolia, see link:http://eepurl.com/iK0YTE[Starknet Goerli Deprecation] in the Starknet Dev News newsletter.
