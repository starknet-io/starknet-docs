= Introduction

Starknet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation – without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to Starknet’s reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system – STARK.

Starknet Contracts and the Starknet OS are written in Cairo – supporting the deployment and scaling of any use case, whatever the business logic.
