Starknet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a _ZK-Rollup_). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation – without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security – thanks to Starknet’s reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system: STARK.

Starknet contracts and the Starknet OS are written in Cairo – supporting the deployment and scaling of any use case, whatever the business logic.
