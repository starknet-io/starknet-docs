= Performing a Smart Deposit

A _Smart Deposit_ is a deposit that moves funds from L1 to L2 and then triggers subsequent actions. For example, a user can deposit funds and transfer those funds to another recipient, such as an exchange.

The `depositWithMessage` function enables a Smart Deposit. `depositWithMessage` is similar to the `deposit` function, with an additional 256-bit message, which can contain instructions for executing additional actions.

Upon completion, the `depositWithMessage` function triggers a call to a callback function, named `on_receive`, on the L2 contract that receives the deposit. The `on_receive` function receives the deposit message as input.

`on_receive` must return `true` for the deposit to succeed. If `on_receive` returns `false`, or if the recipient contract does not include the `on_receive` function, the `depositWithMessage` function's L1 handler fails. The user can recover their funds using the `depositWithMessageCancelRequest` function.

.To enable Smart Deposits in your application:

. Implement the `on_receive` function in the L2 contract that should receive deposits.
. Use the `depositWithMessage` function to transfer funds from L1 to L2.
