[#deposit]
=== `deposit`

[discrete]
==== Description

Deposits the specified amount of an ERC-20 token to the L1 StarkGate bridge contract.

The deposit function does the following:

* Checks that the funds transferred are within the xref:starkgate-bridge.adoc#starkgate_alpha_limitations[Starknet Alpha limitations]
* Transfers the funds from the caller's account to the Starknet bridge contract
* Emits the `Deposit` event with the sender's address on L1, the recipient's address on L2, and the amount

[#depositCancelRequest]
=== `depositCancelRequest`

[discrete]
==== Description

Sends a request to StarkGate to cancel a deposit.

You can send a cancellation request if the funds you transfer from L1 to L2 do not appear on L2 within a reasonable amount of time.

In order to guard against an attack on Starknet, it takes approximately five days to cancel a deposit. When StarkGate receives the cancellation request, a counter begins. When exactly five days have passed, and the funds still do not appear on L2, you can reclaim the deposit using the xref:#depositReclaim[`depositReclaim`] function.

The `depositReclaim` function can only be used once for any deposit cancellation request.

[#depositWithMessage]
=== `depositWithMessage`

[discrete]
==== Description

Similar to xref:#deposit[`deposit`], with a message attached.

With this function, a deposit transaction can trigger subsequent actions. For example, you can deposit funds and include a message to transfer those funds to another address. `depositWithMessage` lets you execute these two separate transactions with a single user action.

After depositing to another recipient, the L1 handler in `token_bridge.cairo` calls the `on_receive` function in the contract of the recipient.

If `on_receive` returns `true`, then the `on_receive` function succeeded. If it returns `false`, or if it doesn't return any value because the `on_receive` function is not implemented in the recipient contract, the operation fails and the transaction is reverted.

//

Creates a Starknet bridge for the specified ERC-20 token contract address in the multi-token bridge contracts and adds the token to the StarkGate Registry.

Does not work for any ERC-20 token bridge's contract address that is already in the registry.

Enrolling a new bridge creates a new ERC-20 contract on L2. You can see the class hash for this contract using xref:#get_erc20_class_hash[`get_erc20_class_hash`].

[#get_erc20_class_hash]
=== `get_erc20_class_hash`

[discrete]
==== Description

Returns the current class hash of the implementation used by the ERC-20 contract. Use the class hash as the type when deploying the ERC-20 contract on L2.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If StarkWare changes the class hash such that it is no longer the class hash that you used when deploying your bridge contract, this function returns the new class hash. If you want to refer to the class hash that you used when deploying your contract, see your deployed contract on Starknet.

'''

[#on_receive]
=== `on_receive`

[discrete]
==== Description

An interface to an implementation of the `on_receive` function that you must provide in your L2 contract in order to enable the `depositWithMessage` function to succeed.

// When calling the `depositWithMessage` function, the resulting transaction triggers an `on_receive` function that you need to implement in your application.
//
The L2 contract that receives the message that is sent with the `depositWithMessage` function must implement a callback function named `on_receive`.

Upon completion, the `depositWithMessage` function triggers a call to the `on_receive` callback function on the receiving L2 contract. The `on_receive` function receives the deposit message as input, and it must return `true` for the deposit to succeed.

If `on_receive` returns `false`, or if the receiving contract does not implement `on_receive`, the `depositWithMessage` L1 handler fails, and the user can only recover their funds using the xref:#depositWithMessageCancelRequest[`depositWithMessageCancelRequest`] function.

[discrete]
==== Parameters

[horizontal,labelwidth="35",role=stripes-odd]
`_l2_token_: ContractAddress`:: The L2 address of the ERC-20 token contract.
`_amount_: uint256`:: The amount deposited.
`_depositor_`: EthAddress:: L1 address of the deposit sender.
`_message_: Span<felt252>`:: The message that was sent with the `depositWithMessage` function.

[discrete]
==== Returns

[horizontal,labelwidth="25",role=stripes-odd]
`true`:: The `on_receive` function completed successfully.
`false`:: The `on_receive` function did not complete successfully. The transaction is reverted.
// The recipient L2 contract of the `depositWithMessage` function does not accept the funds on L2.
No value:: If the recipients's smart contract does not implement the `on_receive` function, the call fails to execute, and the transaction is reverted.
