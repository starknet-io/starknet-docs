= Adding a token to StarkGate

StarkGate supports permissionless bridging.
You can add support for a token with the `enrollTokenBridge` function, using a block explorer or a CLI.

The L2 ERC-20 contract is a standard contract, so it is not recommended to add tokens with non-standard behavior, such as inflationary tokens.

include::partial$snippet_enrollTokenBridge_note.adoc[]

Adding a token that requires a customized bridging mechanism or a non-standard ERC-20 contract on L2 is currently not pemissionless, and can be done only by the StarkWare team. Please contact StarkWare at starkgate.support@starkware.co.
