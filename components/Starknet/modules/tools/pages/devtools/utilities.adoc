While not under any specific category, these tools can be helpful in various stages of development.

[#usc]
== Universal Sierra Compiler
While Scarb compiles full projects, and produces both Sierra and CASM files, it is often needed to only compile a single Sierra file to CASM (for example, when getting a class from Starknet mainnet). The Universal Sierra Compiler supports all sierra versions, and can compile the the a CASM file.

[NOTE]
====
The USC comes bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.

[#cairo-playground]
== Cairo Playground

If want to dive deep into the Cairo VM, and experiment writing Cairo online, and don't want to deploy a smart contract on Starknet, the Cairo Playground is a great way to do so.

[#starknet-devnet-js]
== Starknet Devnet JS
A JavaScript package, abstracting the Starknet Devnet API, making it easier to interact with starknet-devnet-rs.
This simplifies writing end-to-end tests using Devnet, including tests for L1<>L2 communications.

Notable features:

* Spawn a new Devnet instance without installing it
* Wrapping RPC calls to Devnet
* Abstracting complex L1<>L2 communication setup with a local L1 node (e.g. Anvil)
