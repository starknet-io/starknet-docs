== Introduction

To support its unique architecture, Starknet boasts its own xref:#list_of_tools[suite of developer tools] (also known as _devtools_) that aim to streamline the development process for Starknet developers. While sometimes developed in coordination with StarkWare, the majority of these tools are community-driven projects, showcasing the collaborative and innovative spirit of the Starknet ecosystem.
