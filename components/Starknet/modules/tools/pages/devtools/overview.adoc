= Starknet devtools reference

Cairo is a turing complete language for writing provable programs. It is also the language used for writing smart contracts for Starknet. Starknet uses a different model than the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and as such, requires specialized developer tools (devtools).

The following list of devtools is dynamic and continously updated. If a tool you are using is missing, please consider openning an issue or editing the page by yourself.

== Coding in Cairo

The following tools the recommended tools for writing Cairo in general, but can also be helpful for developing on Starknet.

[#interacting-with-starknet]
== Interacting with Starknet

The following tools are the recommended tools for interacting with Starknet, including fetching and analyzing the network's data, declaring, deploying and interacting with smart contracts, generating RPC queries, and more.

[#starkli]
=== Starkli

https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli/[Starkli^], developed by https://x.com/xjonathanlei[Jonathan Lei^], is a fast command-line interface for interacting with Starknet. It supports fetching data from the Starknet network, deploying accounts, interacting with contracts, and other useful utilities for developers. 

[#sncast]
=== sncast
Part of the Starknet Foundry suite, https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/starknet/sncast-overview.html[`sncast`^] is a command line interface for interacting with Starknet, which includes deep integration with Starknet Foundry projects.

[#sdks]
=== Starknet SDKs

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a library that abstracts the complexities of Starknet when building transactions and interacting with the blockchain. SDKs implement the Starknet https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs[JSON RPC specification^], and are updated to support the latest API changes. There are SDKs for various languages, so you can choose the SDK according to your needs.
