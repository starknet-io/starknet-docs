= Starknet SDKs

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a library that abstracts the complexities of Starknet when building transactions and interacting with the blockchain, including the following:

* Read the chain state.
* Account creation and management.
* Cryptography: signature verification and signing, computing hashes used by Starknet.
* Contract declaration and deployment.
* Contract interactions: ABI import, constructing transactions.

SDKs implement the Starknet link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs[JSON RPC specification], and are updated to support the latest API changes. There are SDKs for various languages, so you can choose the SDK according to your needs.
