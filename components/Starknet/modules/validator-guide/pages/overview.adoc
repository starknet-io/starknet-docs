= The Starknet validator guide overview

== Introduction

Starknet is transitioning to allocate more responsibilities to the validators in the next phase of the staking roadmap, where validators have to attest blocks during a specific window. Sepolia testnet network has already been upgraded to the specs outlined at https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-28-staking-v2-proposal/115250[SNIP-28^], allowing validators to test their set-up in anticipation of the mainnet upgrade.

This comprehensive guide will teach you step by step on how to run your own full node and validator on Sepolia testnet.
