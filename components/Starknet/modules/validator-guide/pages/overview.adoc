= The Starknet validator guide overview

== Introduction

Ready to run your first node on Starknet? Then you came to the right place! This comprehensive guide will teach you step by step on how to run your own full node on Sepolia testnet. Additionally, we will also provide steps on how to run your own block attestation service, as this became a new requirement for validators to be eligible for staking rewards (Refer to https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-28-staking-v2-proposal/115250[SNIP-28^] to learn more).
