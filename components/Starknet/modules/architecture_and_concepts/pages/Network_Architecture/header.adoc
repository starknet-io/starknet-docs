= Block structure

In Starknet, the block is defined as a list of transactions and a block header containing the following fields:


[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Implemented

| `parent_block_hash` | `FieldElement` | The hash of this block's parent | &#10003;
|`block_number` | `Integer` | The number (height) of this block | &#10003;
| `global_state_root` | `FieldElement` | The state xref:../Network_Architecture/State/starknet-state.adoc#state_commitment[commitment] after this block | &#10003;
|`sequencer_address` | `FieldElement` | The Starknet address of the sequencer who created this block | &#10003;
| `block_timestamp` | `Timestamp` | The time the sequencer created this block before executing transactions | &#10003;
|`transaction_count` | `Integer` | The number of transactions in a block | &#10003;
| `transaction_commitment` | `FieldElement` | A commitment to the transactions included in the block | &#10003;
|`event_count` | `Integer` | The number of events | &#10003;
| `event_commitment` | `FieldElement` | A commitment to the events produced in this block | &#10003;
| `protocol_version` | `Integer` | The version of the Starknet protocol used when creating this block |
| `extra data` | `FieldElement` | Extraneous data that might be useful for running transactions |
|===

[NOTE]
====
The commitment fields `event_commitment` and `transaction_commitment` are the roots of a height 64 binary Merkle Patricia tree.

For `event_commitment`, the leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to the hash of the stem:[$i'th$] event.

For `transaction_commitment`, the leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to stem:[$h(transaction \ hash, signature)$] if the stem:[$i'th$] transaction is an `invoke` transaction and stem:[$h(0,0)$] otherwise.

[id="block_hash"]
== Block hash

The block hash is defined as the Pedersen hash over the header's elements.

Zeros inside the hash computation of an object are used as placeholders, to be replaced in the future by meaningful fields.
