= Block structure

A Starknet block is a list of transactions and a block header that contains the following fields:


[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `parent_block_hash` | `FieldElement` | The hash of the block's parent.
|`block_number` | `Integer` | The number, that is, the height, of this block.
| `global_state_root` | `FieldElement` | The xref:../Network_Architecture/starknet-state.adoc#state_commitment[state commitment] after the block.
|`sequencer_address` | `ContractAddress` | The Starknet address of the sequencer that created the block.
| `block_timestamp` | `Timestamp` | The time at which the sequencer began building the block, in seconds since the Unix epoch.
|`transaction_count` | `Integer` | The number of transactions in the block.
| `transaction_commitment` | `FieldElement` | A commitment to the transactions included in the block.

The root of a height-64 binary Merkle Patricia trie. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to stem:[$${h(\text{transaction_hash}, \text{signature})}$$].
|`event_count` | `Integer` | The number of events in the block.
| `event_commitment` | `FieldElement` | A commitment to the events produced in the block.

The root of a height-64 binary Merkle Patricia trie. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to the hash of the stem:[$i'th$] event.
| `l1_gas_price` | `(Integer, Integer)` | The price of L1 gas that was used while constructing the block. L1 gas prices apply to storage updates and L1->L2 messages. As of March 2023, computation is also priced in terms of L1 gas, but this will change in the future.

The first `Integer` value is the price in wei. The second is the price in fri.
| `l1_data_gas_price` | `(Integer, Integer)` | The price of L1 blob gas that was used while constructing the block. If the `l1_DA_MODE` of the block is set to `BLOB`, L1 blob gas prices determines the storage update cost.

The first `Integer` value is the price in wei. The second is the price in fri.
| `l1_da_mode` | `String` | `CALLDATA` or `BLOB`, depending on how Starknet state diffs are sent to L1.
| `protocol_version` | `String` | The version of the Starknet protocol used when creating the block.

// Where:
//
//
// [horizontal,labelwidth='30']
// `event_commitment`:: is the root of a 64-bit high binary Merkle Patricia trie. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to the hash of the stem:[$i'th$] event.
// `transaction_commitment`:: is the root of a 64-bit high binary Merkle Patricia trie. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to stem:[$${h(transaction \space hash, signature)}$$] if the stem:[$i'th$] transaction is an `invoke` transaction and stem:[$h(0,0)$] otherwise.




[#block_hash]
== Block hash

A block hash is defined as the Pedersen hash of the header's fields, as follows:

[,,subs="quotes"]
----
_h_(ùêµ) = _h_(
    block_number,
    global_state_root,
    sequencer_address,
    block_timestamp,
    transaction_count,
    transaction_commitment,
    event_count,
    event_commitment,
    0,
    0,
    parent_block_hash
)
----

Where `_h_` is the xref:../../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen-hash[Pedersen hash].

[NOTE]
====
Zeros inside the hash computation of an object are used as placeholders, to be replaced in the future by meaningful fields.

[NOTE]
====
Several properties of the block header, such as `l1_gas_price` and `l1_da_mode`, are not yet included in the block hash. This will change in a future Starknet version.
