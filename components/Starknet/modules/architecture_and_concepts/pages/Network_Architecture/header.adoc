= Block structure

In Starknet, a block is a list of transactions, and a block header that contains the following fields:


[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Implemented

| `parent_block_hash` | `FieldElement` | The hash of this block's parent | &#10003;
|`block_number` | `Integer` | The number (height) of this block | &#10003;
| `global_state_root` | `FieldElement` | The state xref:../Network_Architecture/starknet-state.adoc#state_commitment[commitment] after this block | &#10003;
|`sequencer_address` | `FieldElement` | The Starknet address of the sequencer who created this block | &#10003;
| `block_timestamp` | `Timestamp` | The time the sequencer created this block before executing transactions | &#10003;
|`transaction_count` | `Integer` | The number of transactions in a block | &#10003;
| `transaction_commitment` | `FieldElement` | A commitment to the transactions included in the block | &#10003;
|`event_count` | `Integer` | The number of events | &#10003;
| `event_commitment` | `FieldElement` | A commitment to the events produced in this block | &#10003;
| `protocol_version` | `Integer` | The version of the Starknet protocol used when creating this block |
| `extra data` | `FieldElement` | Extraneous data that might be useful for running transactions |
|===

Where:


[horizontal,labelwidth='30']
`event_commitment`:: is the root of a 64-bit high binary Merkle Patricia tree. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to the hash of the stem:[$i'th$] event.
`transaction_commitment`:: is the root of a 64-bit high binary Merkle Patricia tree. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to stem:[$${h(transaction \space hash, signature)}$$] if the stem:[$i'th$] transaction is an `invoke` transaction and stem:[$h(0,0)$] otherwise.




[#block_hash]
== Block hash

A block hash is defined as the Pedersen hash of the header's fields, as follows:

[,,subs="quotes"]
----
_h_(ùêµ) = _h_(
    block_number,
    global_state_root,
    sequencer_address,
    block_timestamp,
    transaction_count,
    transaction_commitment,
    event_count,
    event_commitment,
    0,
    0,
    parent_block_hash
)
----

Where `_h_` is the xref:../../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen-hash[Pedersen hash].

[NOTE]
====
Zeros inside the hash computation of an object are used as placeholders, to be replaced in the future by meaningful fields.
