[id="transaction_structure"]
= Transaction types

Starknet supports the following types of transactions:

* _invoke_ transaction
* _declare_ transaction
* _deploy_account_ transaction

This topic describes the available fields for these transaction types and how each transaction hash is calculated.

[id="transaction_versioning"]
== Transaction versioning

Starknet supports the transaction versions described here.

When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block.
====

[id="deploy_transaction"]

=== Deploy transaction hash calculation

In order to calculate the transaction hash, we first need to obtain the deployed contract address. The Deploy transaction's hash is calculated as follows:

[source,cairo]
----
deploy_tx_hash = ℎ(
    "deploy",
    version,
    contract_address,
    sn_keccak("constructor"),
    ℎ(constructor_calldata),
    0,
    chain_id
)
----

Where:

* The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions.
* “deploy” and “constructor” are constant strings encoded in ASCII.
* stem:[$h$] is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash and
stem:[$sn\_keccak$] is xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#starknet_keccak[Starknet Keccak].
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:#chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `contract_address` is calculated as described xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-address.adoc[here].

[id=invoke_transaction]
== Invoke transaction

The invoke transaction is the main transaction type used to invoke contract functions in Starknet.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Invoke transaction version 0 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Starknet.

specifically:

[source,cairo]
----

    "invoke",
    version,
    sender_address,
    0,

[id="declare-transaction"]
== Declare transaction

The declare transaction is used to introduce new classes into the state of Starknet, enabling other contracts to deploy instances of those classes or use them in a library call. For more information, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-classes.adoc[contract classes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
New Cairo 1.0 classes can only be declared via the declare v2 transaction.

v1 used to declare Cairo 0 classes are deprecated and will be removed in a future Starknet version.

v0 is no longer supported.

[id=deploy_account_transaction]
## Deploy account transaction

Since xref:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet v0.10.1] the `deploy_account`
transaction replaces the `deploy` transaction
for deploying account contracts.

To use it, you should first pre-fund your would-be account address so that you could pay the
transaction fee (see xref:Accounts/deploying_new_accounts.adoc[here] for more details)
. You can then send the `deploy_account`
transaction.

A `deploy_account` transaction has the following fields:

.Deploy account fields

| Name | Type | Description

| `class_hash` | `FieldElement` | The hash of the desired account class.
| `constructor_calldata` | `List<FieldElement>` | The arguments to the account constructor.

[id="signature"]
== Signature

While Starknet does not have a specific signature scheme built into the protocol, the Cairo language, in which smart contracts are written, does have an efficient implementation for ECDSA signature with respect to a xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#stark_curve[STARK-friendly curve].

The generator used in the ECDSA algorithm is stem:[G=\left(g_x, g_y\right)] where:

stem:[g_x=874739451078007766457464989774322083649278607533249481151382481072868806602] stem:[g_y=152666792071518830868575557812948353041420400780739481342941381225525861407]

[id="chain-id"]
== Chain-Id

Starknet currently supports three chain IDs. Chain IDs are given as numbers, representing the ASCII encoding of specific constant strings, as illustrated by the following Python snippet:

[source,python]
----
chain_id = int.from_bytes(value, byteorder="big", signed=False)
----
Three constants are currently used:

* `SN_MAIN` for Starknet's main network.
* `SN_GOERLI` for Starknet's public testnet.
* `SN_GOERLI2` for Starknet developers.
