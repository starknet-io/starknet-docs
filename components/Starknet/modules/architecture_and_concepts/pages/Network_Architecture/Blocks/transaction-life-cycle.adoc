[id="transaction_lifecycle"]
= Transaction lifecycle

The following are the possible statuses of a transaction from the moment it's sent by the user to the moment it's validated by L1.

[NOTE]
====
The `PENDING` transaction status has been removed in Starknet v0.12.0.
====

[id="transaction_status"]
== Transaction status

[id="not_received"]
=== NOT_RECEIVED

Transaction is not yet known to the sequencer.

[id="received"]
=== RECEIVED

Transaction was received by the sequencer.
Transaction will now either execute successfully or be rejected.

[id="accepted_on_l2"]
=== ACCEPTED_ON_L2

Transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2.

[id="accepted_on_l1"]
=== ACCEPTED_ON_L1

Transaction was accepted on-chain.

[id="rejected"]
=== REJECTED

Transaction executed unsuccessfully and thus was skipped (applies both to a pending and an actual created block).
Possible reasons for transaction rejection:

* An assertion failed during the execution of the transaction (in Starknet, unlike in Ethereum, transaction executions do not always succeed).
* The block may be rejected on L1, thus changing the transaction status to `REJECTED`.


[id="transaction-receipt"]
== Transaction receipt

The transaction receipt contains basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block),
a summary of the execution resources used by the transaction, the events emitted, a list of messages sent to L1,
and a consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler). The following is an example of a receipt:
