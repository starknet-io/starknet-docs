Starknet is a coordinated system, with each component—sequencers,
provers, and nodes—playing a specific yet interconnected role. Although
Starknet is not yet fully decentralized, it’s actively moving toward
that goal. This description of the system's roles and how they interact should
help you better grasp the intricacies of the Starknet ecosystem.

== Transaction flow

Starknet’s operation begins when a transaction is received by a gateway,
which serves as the Mempool. This stage could also be managed by the
sequencer. The transaction is initially marked as `RECEIVED`. The
sequencer then incorporates the transaction into the network state and
tags it as `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`. The final step involves the prover, which
executes the operating system on the new block, calculates its proof,
and submits it to Layer 1 (L1) for verification.

In essence, Starknet’s architecture involves multiple components:

* The _sequencer_ receives transactions, orders
  them, and produces blocks. It operates similarly to validators in
  Ethereum or Bitcoin.

* The _prover_ generates proofs for the created blocks
  and transactions. It uses the Cairo Virtual Machine (Cairo VM) to run provable
  programs, thereby creating execution traces necessary for generating
  STARK proofs.

* L1, in this case, Ethereum, hosts a smart contract capable
  of verifying these STARK proofs. If the proofs are valid, Starknet’s
  state root on L1 is updated.

== Starknet's state

Starknet’s state is a comprehensive snapshot maintained through Merkle
trees, much like in Ethereum. This establishes the architecture of the
validity roll-up and the roles of each component.

// After exploring the introductory overview of the different components,
// delve deeper into their specific roles by referring to their dedicated
// subchapters.

== Sequencers

Sequencers are the backbone of the Starknet network, similar to Ethereum’s
validators. They usher transactions into the system.

Validity Rollups, also known as ZK-Rollups,  excel at offloading some network chores, like bundling
and processing transactions, to specialized players. This setup is
similar to how Ethereum and Bitcoin delegate security to miners.
Sequencing, like mining, demands hefty resources.

Validity Rollups like Starknet outsource transaction processing to specialized
entities and then verify their work. These specialized entities, in the
context of Validity Rollups, are known as _sequencers_.

Instead of providing security, as miners do, sequencers provide
transaction capacity. They order, that is, sequence, multiple transactions into a
single batch, execute them, and produce a block that is later
proved by the prover and submitted to the Layer 1 network as a single,
compact proof, known as a _rollup_. Just as validators
in Ethereum and miners in Bitcoin are specialized actors securing the
network, sequencers in Validity Rollup-based networks are specialized
actors that provide transaction capacity.

This mechanism enables Validity Rollups to handle a higher volume
of transactions while maintaining the security of the underlying
Ethereum network, enhancing scalability without compromising on
security.

Sequencers follow a systematic method for processing transactions:

. Sequencing: They collect transactions from users and order them.

. Executing: Sequencers then process these transactions.

. Batching: Transactions are grouped together in batches for
efficiency.

. Block Production: Sequencers produce blocks that contain batches of
processed transactions.

Sequencers must be reliable and highly available, as their role is
critical to the network’s smooth functioning. They need powerful and
well-connected machines to perform their role effectively, as they must process transactions rapidly and continuously.

The current roadmap for Starknet includes decentralizing the sequencer
role. This shift towards decentralization will enable more participants
to become sequencers, contributing to the robustness of the network.

== Provers

Provers serve as the second line of verification in the Starknet
network. Their main task is to validate the work of the sequencers, when
they receive the block produced by the sequencer, and to generate proofs
that these processes were correctly performed.

A prover does the following:

. *Receives blocks:* Provers receive blocks of processed transactions
from sequencers.

. *Processes blocks:* Provers process these blocks a second time, ensuring
that all transactions within the block have been correctly handled.

. *Generates a proof:* After processing, provers generate a proof of
correct transaction processing.

. *Sends the proof to Ethereum:* Finally, the proof is sent to the
Ethereum network for validation. If the proof is correct, the
Ethereum network accepts the block of transactions.

Provers need even more computational power than sequencers because they
have to calculate and generate proofs, a process that is computationally
heavy. However, the work of provers can be split into multiple parts,
allowing for parallelism and efficient proof generation. The proof
generation process is asynchronous, meaning it doesn’t have to occur
immediately or in real-time. This flexibility allows for the workload to
be distributed among multiple provers. Each prover can work on a
different block, allowing for parallelism and efficient proof
generation.

The design of Starknet relies on these two types of actors—sequencers
and provers—working in tandem to ensure efficient processing and
secure verification of transactions.

== Optimizing sequencers and provers: Debunking common misconceptions

The relationship between sequencers and provers in blockchain technology
often sparks debate. A common misunderstanding suggests that either the
prover or the sequencer is the main bottleneck. To set the record
straight, let’s discuss the optimization of both components.

Starknet, which uses the Cairo programming language, currently supports
only sequential transactions. Plans are in place to introduce parallel
transactions in the future. However, as of now, the sequencer operates
one transaction at a time, making it the bottleneck in the system.

In contrast, provers operate asynchronously and can execute multiple
tasks in parallel. The use of proof recursion allows for task
distribution across multiple machines, making scalability less of an
issue for provers.

// I'd prefer not to discuss time-bound info, like current development focus, unless we keep ith within the bounds of specific release versions.
//Given the asynchronous and scalable nature of provers, Starknet development
// is currently focused on enhancing the sequencer’s efficiency.

== Nodes

When it comes to defining what nodes do in Bitcoin or Ethereum, people
often misinterpret their role as keeping track of every transaction
within the network. This, however, is not entirely accurate.

Nodes serve as auditors of the network, maintaining the state of the
network, such as how much Bitcoin each participant owns or the current
state of a specific smart contract. They maintain network state by processing
transactions and preserving a record of all transactions, but that is a
means to an end, not the end itself.

In Validity Rollups and specifically within Starknet, this concept is
somewhat reversed. Nodes don’t necessarily have to process transactions
to get the state. In contrast to Ethereum or Bitcoin, Starknet nodes
aren’t required to process all transactions to maintain the state of the
network.

You can access network state data by using the Starknet API, which uses the JSON RPC protocol, to communicate with a node. Previously, Starknet's Gateway and Feeder Gateway APIs enabled querying the sequencer, but as the network has matured, the JSON RPC has become the standard.
Operating your own node is typically faster than using a shared architecture, like the
gateway.

It’s worth noting that more people running nodes increases
the resilience of the network and prevents server flooding, which has
been an issue in other L2 networks.

Currently, there are primarily three methods for a node to keep track of
the network’s state and nodes can implement any of these
methods:

. *Replaying Old Transactions*: Like Ethereum or Bitcoin, a node can
take all the transactions and re-execute them. Although this approach is
accurate, it isn’t scalable unless you have a powerful machine that’s
capable of handling the load. If you can replay all transactions, you
can become a sequencer.

. *Relying on L2 Consensus*: Nodes can trust the sequencer to
execute the network correctly. When the sequencer updates the state and
adds a new block, nodes accept the update as accurate.

. *Checking Proof Validation on L1*: Nodes can monitor the state of
the network by observing L1 and ensuring that every time a proof is
sent, they receive the updated state. This way, they don’t have to trust
anyone and only need to keep track of the latest valid transaction for
Starknet.

Each type of node setup comes with its own set of hardware requirements
and trust assumptions.

=== Nodes that replay transactions

Nodes that replay transactions require powerful machines to track and
execute all transactions. These nodes don’t have trust assumptions; they
rely solely on the transactions they execute, guaranteeing that the
state at any given point is valid.

=== Nodes that rely on L2 consensus

Nodes that rely on L2 consensus require less computational power. They
need sufficient storage to keep the state but don’t need to process a
lot of transactions. The tradeoff here is a trust assumption.
Currently, Starknet revolves around one sequencer, so these nodes
trust StarkWare not to disrupt the network. However, once a consensus
mechanism and leader election amongst sequencers are in place, these
nodes will only need to trust that a sequencer who staked their stake to
produce a block is not willing to lose it.

=== Nodes that check proof validation on L1

Nodes that only update their state based on proof validation on L1
require the least hardware. They have the same requirements as an
Ethereum node, and once Ethereum light nodes become a reality,
maintaining such a node could be as simple as using a smartphone. The
only tradeoff is higher latency. Proofs are sent to Ethereum intermittently, not for every block, resulting in delayed state updates. Plans are in
place to produce proofs more frequently, even if they are not sent to
Ethereum immediately, lowering node latency.
