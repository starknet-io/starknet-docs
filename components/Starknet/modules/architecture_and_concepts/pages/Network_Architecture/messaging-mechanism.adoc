[id="l2-l1_messages"]
== L2 → L1 messages

Contracts on L2 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L1 using  the _L2→L1_ messaging protocol.

// What does the protocal consist of? Is it just the syscall?

During the execution of a transaction, a contract on Starknet sends a message from L2 to L1 by calling the https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/4e233516f52477ad158bc81a86ec2760471c1b65/src/starkware/starknet/common/messages.cairo#L4[`send_message_to_L1`] syscall. The message parameters, which include the address of the recipient contract on L1 and the message data, are then attached to the state update that includes this syscall invocation.

// Is there a URL for a syscall that is >Cairo 0?
// What attaches the message parameters to the state update?
// What does it mean that the parameters are _attached_? to the _relevant_ state update--How many state updates are there that it might be attahed to that

For example:

[source,rs]
----
let mut payload: Array<felt252> = ArrayTrait::new();
let to_address: EthAddress = 1_felt252.try_into().unwrap();
payload.append(1);
// potentially add more elements to payload (payload[1], payload[2],  etc.)

send_message_to_l1_syscall(to_address: to_address.into(), payload: payload.span());
----

The sequence is as follows:

. The prover proves the state update that includes this transaction.
. The L1 state is updated.
// what actually updates the state?
. The message is stored on L1 in the Starknet Core Contract and the relevant counter is increased
// What stores the message in the contract?
// What counter? How is it increased?
. The `LogMessageToL1` event, which contains the message parameters, is emitted.


Subsequently, the message recipient on L1
// Is there a message recipient on L2?
// Who is the recipient? Is it a user account contract? Or is it some other contract that requires the message in order to execute some functionality?
can access and consume the message by by calling the https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/4e233516f52477ad158bc81a86ec2760471c1b65/src/starkware/starknet/eth/StarknetMessaging.sol#L119[`consumeMessageFromL2`] function, which include the message parameters within the transaction.
// What's an example of this kind of transaction? Are we only talking about the backend of a dApp? Or is there a way to do this directly as part of a transaction using Starkli?

// who or what calls this? Is this a function?
This #function (is this actually a function???)#, which is part of the Starknet Core Contract, verifies the following:

* The hash corresponds to a stored message.
//hash of what?
* The entity calling the function is indeed the recipient on L1.

// We need to separate out these functions into a reference.

In such a case, the reference count of the message hash in the Starknet Core Contract decreases by 1.

[NOTE]
====
Sending an L2 to L1 message always incurs a fixed 20K gas cost, because the hash of the message being sent must be written to L1 storage in the Starknet Core contract.
====

[id="l1-l2-messages"]
== L1 → L2 messages

Contracts on L1 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L2 via the L1→L2 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages:

. An L1 contract initiates a message to an L2 contract on Starknet. It does so by calling the link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/54d7e92a703b3b5a1e07e9389608178129946efc/src/starkware/starknet/solidity/IStarknetMessaging.sol#L13[`sendMessageToL2`] function on the Starknet Core Contract with the message parameters.
 .. The Starknet Core Contract hashes the message parameters and updates the L1→L2 message mapping to indicate that a message with this hash was indeed sent. In fact, the L1 contract records the fee that the sender paid. For more information, see xref:l1-l2_message_fees[L1 → L2 message fees].
. The message is then decoded into a Starknet transaction that invokes a function annotated with the `l1_handler` decorator on the target contract. Transactions like this on L2 are called *_L1 handler transactions_*.
 .. The Starknet sequencer, upon seeing enough L1 confirmations for the transaction that sent the message, initiates the corresponding L2 transaction.
 .. The L2 transaction invokes the relevant `l1_handler`.
. The L1 Handler transaction that was created in the previous step is added to a proof.
. The state update is received on the Core contract.
. the message is cleared from the Core contract's storage. At this point, the message is handled.

// The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram:
// THIS IMAGE IS WRONG & MISLEADING AND THUS COMMENTED OUT UNTIL FIXED
// image::l1l2.png[l1l2]

An L1→L2 message consists of:

* The L1 sender address
* The recipient contract address on Starknet
* Function selector
* Calldata array
* Message nonce

[NOTE]
====
*Message nonce*

The message nonce is maintained on the Starknet Core contract on L1, and is bumped whenever a message is
sent to L2. It is used to avoid hash collisions between different L1 handler transactions that are induced by the same message being sent on L1 multiple times (see xref:structure_and_hashing_l1-l2[below]).
====

[id="l2-l1_message_cancellation"]
=== L1 → L2 message cancellation

Imagine a scenario where a user transfers an asset from L1 to L2. The flow starts with the user sending the asset to a Starknet bridge and the corresponding L1→L2 message generation. Now, imagine that the L2 message consumption doesn't function (this might happen due to a bug in the dApp's Cairo contract). This could result in the user losing custody over their asset forever.

To mitigate this risk, we allow the contract that initiated the L1→L2 message to cancel it after declaring the intent and waiting a suitable amount of time.

The user starts by calling https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/4e233516f52477ad158bc81a86ec2760471c1b65/src/starkware/starknet/eth/StarknetMessaging.sol#L134[`startL1ToL2MessageCancellation`] with the relevant message parameters in the Starknet Core Contract. Then, after a five days delay, the user can finalize the cancellation by calling https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/4e233516f52477ad158bc81a86ec2760471c1b65/src/starkware/starknet/eth/StarknetMessaging.sol#L147[`cancelL1ToL2Message`].

The reason for the delay is to protect the sequencer from a DOS attack in the form of repeatedly sending and canceling a message before it is included in L1, rendering the L2 block which contains the activation of the corresponding L1 handler invalid.

Note that this flow should only be used in edge cases such as bugs on the Layer 2 contract preventing message consumption.

[id="l1-l2-message-fees"]
=== L1 → L2 message fees

An L1 → L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction's fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block.

To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 → L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function `sendMessageToL2` on the Starknet Core contract.

The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message.

The fee itself is calculated in the xref:../Network_Architecture/fee-mechanism.adoc#overall_fee[same manner] as
"regular" L2 transactions. You can use the xref:documentation:cli:starkli.adoc#starknet-estimate_fee[CLI] to get an estimate of an L1 → L2 message fee.

[id="structure_and_hashing_l1-l2"]
=== L1 → L2 structure and hashing

For completeness, we describe the precise structure of both the message as it appears on L1 and the induced transaction as it appears on L2.

| `EthereumAddress` | `FieldElement` | `FieldElement` | `List+++<FieldElement>+++` | `FieldElement` |

The hash of the message is computed on L1 as follows:

    abi.encodePacked(
        uint256(FromAddress),
        ToAddress,

| `FieldElement` | `FieldElement`  | `FieldElement` | `List+++<FieldElement>+++` | `FieldElement` |
|===

The hash of the corresponding L1 handler transaction on L2 is computed as follows:

[source,cairo]
----
l1_handler_tx_hash = ℎ(
    "l1_handler",
    version,
    contract_address,
    entry_point_selector,
    ℎ(calldata),
    chain_id,
    nonce
)

Where:

- stem:[\text{l1_handler}] is a constant prefix, encoded in bytes (ASCII), with big-endian.
- stem:[\text{chain_id}] is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent.
- stem:[$$h$$] is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash

[NOTE]
====
In an `l1_handler` transaction, the first element of the calldata is always the Ethereum address of the sender.
