== Introduction

In the current stage of the Alpha, Starknet operates in Validity Rollup mode, also referred to as ZK-Rollup mode. So when the onchain state update is accepted, the state diff between the previous and new state is sent as calldata to Ethereum.

This data allows anyone that observes Ethereum to reconstruct the current state of Starknet.

[NOTE]
====
To update the Starknet state on L1, it suffices to send a valid proof, without information
on the transactions or particular changes that this update caused.

Consequently, more information must be provided in order to allow other parties to locally track Starknet's state.

== Data availability: v0.11.0 and forward


[id="v0.11.0_format"]
=== v0.11.0 format

The state diffs contain information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments.

For each affected contract, the following information is sent as calldata on L1:

* The contract address
* A single word that encodes the following:
+
--
** class information flag, whose value is one of the following:
+
0: Storage updates only. +
1: contract was deployed or replaced in this state update.
+
When this flag is set to 1, the new class hash occupies an additional word before the storage
updates section.
** nonce
** number of storage updates
--
+
The expected format:
+
[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{127 bits}}|
\underbrace{\text{class information flag}}_{\text{1 bit}}|
\underbrace{\text{new nonce}}_{\text{64 bits}}|{
\underbrace{\text{# of storage updates}}_{\text{64 bits}}}_{\text{LSB}}
++++

Each storage update includes the following:

* key - the address inside the contractâ€™s storage where the value is updated
* value - the new value

Newly declared classes include the following:

* The number of Cairo classes that were declared in the block
* Each class includes the following:
** The class hash
** xref:Smart_Contracts/class-hash.adoc[The compiled class hash]

* The first element, `1`, is the number of contracts whose state was updated.

* The third element, `18446744073709551617`, which is 2^64^+1, encodes the following:
** The class information flag is `0`, that is, the contract was not deployed or replaced just now, so you shouldn't treat the next word as the class hash.
** The new nonce is `1`.
** One storage cell was updated.
* The next two elements, `100` and `200`, encode the storage update, where the value of key `100` is set to `200`.
* the new declare section: `1` includes a single xref:Network_Architecture/transactions.adoc#declare_v2[declare v2] transaction in this state update, and the next two elements
encode xref:../Smart_Contracts/class-hash.adoc[the class hash] and the compiled class hash of the declared class.

[id="pre_v0.11.0_format"]
=== Pre v0.11.0 format

The state diffs contain information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments. Those differences are sent as `uint256[]` array as part of the calldata, and are encoded as follows:

* Number of cells that encode contract deployments
* For each deployed contract, we have:

xref:Smart_Contracts/contract-address.adoc

 ** `contract_address` - the xref:Network_Architecture/on-chain-data.adoc[address] of the deployed contract
 ** `contract_hash` - the xref:../Smart_Contracts/class-hash.adoc[hash] of the class
* Number of contracts whose storage is updated
* For each such contract, we have:
 ** `contract_address` - the xref:../Network_Architecture/on-chain-data.adoc[address] of the contract
 ** `num_of_storage_updates` - number of storage updates
 ** `nonce, num of storage updates ` - a uint256 value that encodes both the number of storage updates for that contract and the updated nonce:
+
[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{128 bits}} | \underbrace{\text{new nonce}}_{\text{64 bits}} |
{\underbrace{\text{# of storage updates}}_{\text{64 bits}}}_{\text{LSB}}
++++
 ** For each storage update:
  *** `key` - the address inside the contract's storage where the value is updated
  *** `value` - the new value

**  Following the above contract address, we have `18446744073709551617` (index 8 in the array), which is stem:[$2^{64}+1$], thus:
  *** The new contract nonce is `1`
  *** One storage key is updated
  *** The value at key `5` was changed to `102`

The next 4 contract storage updates are interpreted in the same manner.

[id="extract_from_ethereum"]
== Extract from Ethereum

The data described above is sent across several Ethereum transactions, each holding a part of this array as calldata. Each new Starknet block has its associated state diff transactions.

You can find the code for extracting this data from Ethereum in https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/2fe6f549a0b8b9923ed7a21cd1a588bc571657d6/crates/pathfinder/src/ethereum/state_update/retrieve.rs[Pathfinder's repo]. Pathfinder is the first Starknet full node implementation. You may also take a look at the https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/2fe6f549a0b8b9923ed7a21cd1a588bc571657d6/crates/pathfinder/resources/fact_retrieval.py[Python script] which extracts the same information.
