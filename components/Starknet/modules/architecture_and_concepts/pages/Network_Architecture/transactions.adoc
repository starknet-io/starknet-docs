[id="transaction_structure"]
= Transaction types

Starknet supports the following types of transactions:

[horizontal,labelwidth="20"]
_Declare_:: Declares new contract classes, enabling new contract instances.
_Invoke_:: Invokes an existing function in a contract.
_Deploy account_:: Deploys new account contracts in smart wallets.

This topic describes the available fields for these transaction types and how each transaction's hash is calculated.

[id="transaction_versioning"]
== Transaction versions

When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

Deprecated transaction versions are still supported, but support will be removed in a future release of Starknet.

.Supported versions of Starknet transaction types
[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Transaction name |Current version |Deprecated versions | Unsupported versions

|*Invoke* | v3 |v1, v0 | N/A
|*Declare* |v3 |v2, v1 | v0
|*Deploy account* | v3 | v0 | N/A
|*Deploy* | N/A | N/A | v0
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block.
====

[id=invoke_transaction]
== *Invoke* transaction

:invoke:

// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// Invoke transaction versions 0 and 1 are deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Starknet.
// ====

The Invoke transaction type invokes a function in an existing contract instance. The contract code of the account that sends the Invoke transaction determines how to process the transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Because an account's `+__validate__+` and `+__execute__+` functions can contain any logic, the account ultimately determines how to handle the Invoke transaction.
====

Every Invoke transaction in Starknet undergoes the validation and execution stages, initiated by the `+__validate__+` and `+__execute__+` functions. The validation stage verifies that the account that sent the transaction approves it.

== *Deploy* (unsupported) transaction hash calculation

If you need to retrieve the hash of an existing *Deploy* transaction, you can use this information to calculate the hash of the transaction.

Before you can calculate the transaction hash, get the deployed contract address. The *Deploy* transaction's hash is calculated as shown in the following pseudo code:

== Signature

While Starknet does not have a specific signature scheme built into the protocol, the Cairo language, in which smart contracts are written, does have an efficient implementation for ECDSA signature with respect to a xref:../Cryptography/stark-curve.adoc[STARK-friendly curve].

The generator used in the ECDSA algorithm is stem:[G=\left(g_x, g_y\right)] where:

stem:[g_x=874739451078007766457464989774322083649278607533249481151382481072868806602] stem:[g_y=152666792071518830868575557812948353041420400780739481342941381225525861407]

Chain IDs are given as numbers, representing the ASCII encoding of specific constant strings, as illustrated by the following Python snippet:

The following constants are currently used. They correspond to the chain IDs that Starknet currently supports:

* `SN_MAIN` for Starknet's main network.
* `SN_GOERLI` for Starknet's public testnet.
