[id="transaction_structure"]
= Transaction types

Starknet supports the following types of transactions, as defined in the Starknet API:

[horizontal,labelwidth="20"]
`DECLARE`:: Declares new contract classes, enabling new contract instances.
`INVOKE`:: Invokes an existing function in a contract.
`DEPLOY_ACCOUNT`:: Deploys new account contracts in smart wallets.

To see how these transaction types appear in the Starknet API, see link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/blob/b5c43955b1868b8e19af6d1736178e02ec84e678/api/starknet_api_openrpc.json[starknet_api_openrpc.json].


This topic describes the available fields for these transaction types and how each transaction's hash is calculated.

[id="transaction_versioning"]
== Transaction versions

When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

Deprecated transaction versions are still supported, but support will be removed in a future release of Starknet.

.Supported versions of Starknet transaction types
[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Transaction name |Current version |Deprecated versions | Unsupported versions

|`INVOKE` | v3 |v1, v0 | N/A
|`DECLARE` |v3 |v2, v1 | v0
|`DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` | v3 | v0 | N/A
|`DEPLOY` | N/A | N/A | v0
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block.
====

[id=invoke_transaction]
== `INVOKE` transaction

:invoke:

// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// `INVOKE` transaction versions 0 and 1 are deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Starknet.
// ====

The `INVOKE` transaction type invokes a function in an existing contract instance. The contract code of the account that sends the `INVOKE` transaction determines how to process the transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Because an account's `+__validate__+` and `+__execute__+` functions can contain any logic, the account ultimately determines how to handle the `INVOKE` transaction.
====

Every `INVOKE`  transaction in Starknet undergoes the validation and execution stages, initiated by the `+__validate__+` and `+__execute__+` functions. The validation stage verifies that the account that sent the transaction approves it.

Since xref:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet v0.10.1] the `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT`
transaction replaces the `DEPLOY` transaction
for deploying account contracts.

To use it, you should first pre-fund your new account address so that you can pay the
transaction fee. You can then send the `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction.

[id="deploy_transaction"]
== `DEPLOY` (unsupported) transaction hash calculation

If you need to retrieve the hash of an existing `DEPLOY` transaction, you can use this information to calculate the hash of the transaction.

Before you can calculate the transaction hash, get the deployed contract address. The `DEPLOY` transaction's hash is calculated as shown in the following pseudo code:

deploy_tx_hash = _h_(
    "deploy",

* The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions.
* `deploy` and `constructor` are constant strings encoded in ASCII.
* `_h_` is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash and
`sn_keccak` is xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#starknet_keccak[Starknet Keccak].
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:#chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `contract_address` is calculated as described xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-address.adoc[here].

[id="signature"]
== Signature

While Starknet does not have a specific signature scheme built into the protocol, the Cairo language, in which smart contracts are written, does have an efficient implementation for ECDSA signature with respect to a xref:../Cryptography/stark-curve.adoc[STARK-friendly curve].

The generator used in the ECDSA algorithm is stem:[G=\left(g_x, g_y\right)] where:

stem:[g_x=874739451078007766457464989774322083649278607533249481151382481072868806602] stem:[g_y=152666792071518830868575557812948353041420400780739481342941381225525861407]

Chain IDs are given as numbers, representing the ASCII encoding of specific constant strings, as illustrated by the following Python snippet:

[source,python]
----
chain_id = int.from_bytes(value, byteorder="big", signed=False)
----

The following constants are currently used. They correspond to the chain IDs that Starknet currently supports:

* `SN_MAIN` for Starknet's main network.
* `SN_GOERLI` for Starknet's public testnet on Goerli (Deprecated).
* `SN_SEPOLIA` for Starknet's public testnet on Sepolia.
