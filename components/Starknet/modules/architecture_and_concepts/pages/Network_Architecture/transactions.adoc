[id="transaction_structure"]
= Transaction types

Starknet supports the following types of transactions:

[horizontal,labelwidth="20"]
_Declare_:: Declares new contract classes, enabling new contract instances.
_Invoke_:: Invokes an existing function in a contract.
_Deploy account_:: Deploys new account contracts in smart wallets.

This topic describes the available fields for these transaction types and how each transaction's hash is calculated.

[id="transaction_versioning"]
== Transaction versions

When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block.
====

.Supported versions of Starknet transaction types

|*Declare* |v2, v1, |v0
|*Deploy account* |v1 (first version)|N/A

[NOTE]
====
The *Deploy* transaction type is unsupported. The last supported version was v0.

[id=invoke_transaction]
== *Invoke* transaction

[IMPORTANT]
====
Invoke transaction version 0 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Starknet.
====

The Invoke transaction type invokes an existing function in a Starknet smart contract, or a contract instance. Invoke transactions do not add new functions.

Every Invoke transaction in Starknet undergoes the validation and execution stages, initiated by the `+__validate__+` and `+__execute__+` functions. The validation stage checks the transaction's correctness, similar to a syntax or logic check. After validation, the execution stage processes the transaction.

=== v1 hash calculation

The *Invoke* v1 transaction hash is calculated as a hash over the given transaction elements,
specifically:

[,subs="quotes"]
----
invoke_v1_tx_hash = _h_(
    "invoke",
    version,
    sender_address,
    0,
    _h_(calldata),
    max_fee,
    chain_id,
    nonce
)
----

Where:

* `invoke` is a constant prefix string, encoded in ASCII.
* The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions.
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `_h_` is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash


=== v0 (deprecated) hash calculation


The hash of a v0 invoke transaction is computed as follows:

[,subs="quotes"]
----
invoke_v0_tx_hash = _h_(
    "invoke",
    version,
    contract_address,
    entry_point_selector,
    _h_(calldata),
    max_fee,
    chain_id

----

[id="declare-transaction"]
== *Declare* transaction

The *Declare* transaction introduces new contract classes into the state of Starknet, enabling other contracts to deploy instances of those classes or use them in a library call. For more information, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-classes.adoc[contract classes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only declare Cairo 1.0 classes with the *Declare* v2 transaction type.

v1, which declares Cairo 0 classes, is deprecated and will be removed in a future Starknet version.

v0 is no longer supported.

[id=deploy_account_transaction]
== *Deploy account* transaction

Since xref:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet v0.10.1] the *Deploy account*
transaction replaces the *Deploy* transaction
for deploying account contracts.

To use it, you should first pre-fund your would-be account address so that you could pay the
transaction fee (see xref:Accounts/deploying_new_accounts.adoc[here] for more details)
. You can then send the *Deploy account*
transaction.

A *Deploy account* transaction has the following fields:

=== v1 transaction fields

| Name | Type | Description

| `class_hash` | `FieldElement` | The hash of the desired account class.
| `constructor_calldata` | `List<FieldElement>` | The arguments to the account constructor.

| `nonce` | `FieldElement` | The transaction nonce.

[id="deploy_transaction"]

If you need to retrieve the hash of an existing *Deploy* transaction, you can use this information to calculate the hash of the transaction.

== *Deploy* transaction hash calculation

Before you can calculate the transaction hash, get the deployed contract address. The *Deploy* transaction's hash is calculated as shown in the following pseudo code:

[,subs="quotes"]
----
deploy_tx_hash = _h_(
    "deploy",
    version,
    contract_address,
    sn_keccak("constructor"),
    _h_ constructor_calldata),
    0,
    chain_id
)
----

Where:

* The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions.
* `deploy` and `constructor` are constant strings encoded in ASCII.
* `_h_` is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash and
`sn_keccak` is xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#starknet_keccak[Starknet Keccak].
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:#chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `contract_address` is calculated as described xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-address.adoc[here].

[id="signature"]
== Signature

While Starknet does not have a specific signature scheme built into the protocol, the Cairo language, in which smart contracts are written, does have an efficient implementation for ECDSA signature with respect to a xref:../Cryptography/stark-curve.adoc[STARK-friendly curve].

The generator used in the ECDSA algorithm is stem:[G=\left(g_x, g_y\right)] where:

stem:[g_x=874739451078007766457464989774322083649278607533249481151382481072868806602] stem:[g_y=152666792071518830868575557812948353041420400780739481342941381225525861407]

[id="chain-id"]
== Chain ID

Chain IDs are given as numbers, representing the ASCII encoding of specific constant strings, as illustrated by the following Python snippet:

[source,python]
----
chain_id = int.from_bytes(value, byteorder="big", signed=False)
----

The following constants are currently used. They correspond to the chain IDs that Starknet currently supports:

* `SN_MAIN` for Starknet's main network.
* `SN_GOERLI` for Starknet's public testnet on Goerli (Deprecated).
* `SN_SEPOLIA` for Starknet's public testnet on Sepolia.
