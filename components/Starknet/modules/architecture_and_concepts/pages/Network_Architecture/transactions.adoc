:toc:

Starknet supports the following transactions:

* `invoke`
* `declare`
* `deploy_account`

This topic describes the available fields for these transaction types and how each transaction's hash is calculated.

[id="transaction_versioning"]
== Transaction versions

When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block.
====

.Supported Starknet transaction versions

|`invoke` |v1 |v0
|`declare` |v2 |v1, v0
|`deploy_account` |v0 |

[id=invoke_transaction]
== `invoke` transaction

The invoke transaction is the main transaction type used to invoke contract functions in Starknet.

[IMPORTANT]

Invoke transaction version 0 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Starknet.

=== v1 hash calculation

The `invoke` v1 transaction hash is calculated as a hash over the given transaction elements,
specifically:

[source,cairo,subs="quotes"]
----
invoke_v1_tx_hash = _h_(
    "invoke",
    version,
    sender_address,
    0,
    _h_(calldata),
    max_fee,
    chain_id,
    nonce
)
----

Where:

* `invoke` is a constant prefix string, encoded in ASCII.
* The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions.
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `_h_` is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash


=== v0 (deprecated) hash calculation


The hash of a v0 invoke transaction is computed as follows:

[source,cairo,subs="quotes"]
----
invoke_v0_tx_hash = _h_(
    "invoke",
    version,
    contract_address,
    entry_point_selector,
    _h_(calldata),
    max_fee,
    chain_id
)
----

Where:

* `invoke` is a constant prefix string, encoded in (ASCII).
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `_h_` is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash

[id="declare-transaction"]
== `declare` transaction

The `declare` transaction is used to introduce new classes into the state of Starknet, enabling other contracts to deploy instances of those classes or use them in a library call. For more information, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-classes.adoc[contract classes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
New Cairo 1.0 classes can only be declared via the `declare` v2 transaction.

v1 used to declare Cairo 0 classes are deprecated and will be removed in a future Starknet version.

v0 is no longer supported.

=== v2 hash calculation

The hash of a v2 `declare` transaction is computed as follows:

[source,cairo,subs="quotes"]
----
declare_v2_tx_hash = â„Ž(
    "declare",

    sender_address,
    0,

[source,cairo,subs="quotes"]
----
declare_v0_tx_hash = _h_(
    "declare",
    version,
    sender_address,
    0,

[id=deploy_account_transaction]
== `deploy_account` transaction

Since xref:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet v0.10.1] the `deploy_account`
transaction replaces the `deploy` transaction
for deploying account contracts.

To use it, you should first pre-fund your would-be account address so that you could pay the
transaction fee (see xref:Accounts/deploying_new_accounts.adoc[here] for more details)
. You can then send the `deploy_account`
transaction.

A `deploy_account` transaction has the following fields:

=== v0 transaction fields

.`deploy_account` transaction fields

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `class_hash` | `FieldElement` | The hash of the desired account class.
| `constructor_calldata` | `List<FieldElement>` | The arguments to the account constructor.
| `contract_address_salt` | `FieldElement` | A random salt that determines the xref:Smart_Contracts/contract-address.adoc[account address].
| `signature` | `List<FieldElement>` | Additional information given by the sender, used to validate the transaction.
| `max_fee` | `FieldElement` | The maximum fee that the sender is willing to pay for the transaction
| `nonce` | `FieldElement` | The transaction nonce.
| `version` | `FieldElement` | The transaction's version. The value is 1. +

|===

=== v0 hash calculation

The hash of a `deploy_account` transaction is computed as follows:

[source,cairo,subs="quotes"]
----
deploy_account_tx_hash = _h_(
    "deploy_account",
    version,
    contract_address,
    0,
    _h_(class_hash, contract_address_salt, constructor_calldata),
    max_fee,
    chain_id,
    nonce
)
----

#Missing parameters. Other txs have parameters here.#

[id="deploy_transaction"]

If you need to retrieve the hash of an existing `deploy` transaction, you can use this information to calculate the hash of the transaction.

=== `deploy` transaction hash calculation

#Why do we inlcude the `deploy` transaction at all?#

#If we need to include it, then why don't we include the fields as well?#

In order to calculate the transaction hash, we first need to obtain the deployed contract address. The Deploy transaction's hash is calculated as follows:

[source,cairo,subs="quotes"]
----
deploy_tx_hash = _h_(
    "deploy",
    version,
    contract_address,
    sn_keccak("constructor"),
    _h_ constructor_calldata),
    0,
    chain_id
)
----

Where:

* The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions.
* `deploy` and `constructor` are constant strings encoded in ASCII.
* `_h_` is the xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_hash[Pedersen] hash and
`sn_keccak` is xref:../Cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#starknet_keccak[Starknet Keccak].
* `chain_id` is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See xref:#chain-id[Chain-Id].
* `contract_address` is calculated as described xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/contract-address.adoc[here].

[id="signature"]
== Signature

While Starknet does not have a specific signature scheme built into the protocol, the Cairo language, in which smart contracts are written, does have an efficient implementation for ECDSA signature with respect to a xref:../Cryptography/stark-curve.adoc[STARK-friendly curve].

The generator used in the ECDSA algorithm is stem:[G=\left(g_x, g_y\right)] where:

stem:[g_x=874739451078007766457464989774322083649278607533249481151382481072868806602] stem:[g_y=152666792071518830868575557812948353041420400780739481342941381225525861407]

[id="chain-id"]
== Chain ID

Chain IDs are given as numbers, representing the ASCII encoding of specific constant strings, as illustrated by the following Python snippet:

[source,python]
----
chain_id = int.from_bytes(value, byteorder="big", signed=False)
----

The following constants are currently used. They correspond to the chain IDs that Starknet currently supports:

* `SN_MAIN` for Starknet's main network.
* `SN_GOERLI` for Starknet's public testnet.
