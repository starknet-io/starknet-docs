== Transaction flow

image::transaction-flow.png[]

The transaction lifecycle in Starknet involves the following high level steps:

=== 1. Transaction Submission
A transaction is submitted to one of the gateways, functioning as the Mempool and marks the transaction status as `RECEIVED`.

=== 2. Validation

==== 2.1 Mempool validation
The Mempool performs validation on the transaction to check for its validity. If the transaction is invalid, it will not proceed to the next stages.

==== 2.2 Sequencer validation
The sequencer performs validation on the transaction prior to execution to ensure that the transaction is still valid. If the transaction is invalid, it will not proceed to the next stages.

=== 3. Execution
The sequencer operation sequentially applies the validated transactions to the state. If a transaction fails during execution, it will be included in the block with the status `REVERTED`.

=== 4. Proof Generation
The Prover stage executes the operating system on the new block, computes the proof, and transmits it to L1.

== Transaction status

The diagram below illustrates how each transaction status fits into the overall transaction flow:

The following are the possible statuses of a transaction from the moment it's sent by the user to the moment it's validated by L1:

=== Finality statuses

[id="not_received"]
==== NOT_RECEIVED

The transaction is not yet known to the sequencer.

[id="received"]
==== RECEIVED

The transaction was received by the mempool. The transaction will now either execute successfully, be rejected or be reverted.

[id="accepted_on_l2"]
==== ACCEPTED_ON_L2

The transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2.

[id="accepted_on_l1"]
==== ACCEPTED_ON_L1

The transaction was accepted on Ethereum.

=== Execution statuses

[id="rejected"]
==== REJECTED

The transaction was received by the Mempool but failed validation in the sequencer. Such transactions will not be included in a block.

[id="reverted"]
==== REVERTED

The transaction passed validation but failed during execution in the sequencer. They will be included in the block with the status `REVERTED`.

[id="succeeded"]
==== SUCCEEDED

The transaction was successfully executed by the sequencer.

[id="transaction-state-implications"]
== State Implications of a `REVERTED` Transaction

When a transaction is marked as `REVERTED`, the following state implications occur:

Nonce increases:: The nonce value for the account of the failed transaction will increase despite the failure.

Fee charge:: A fee will be charged for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure.

Partial Reversion:: All changes that occurred during the `validate` stage are not reverted. However, all changes that occurred during the `execute` stage are reverted, including no messages to L1 or events.

Fee Calculation:: The fee charged for `REVERTED` transactions will be calculated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
fee = Min(max_fee, consumed_resources)
----


Consumed Resources:: The `consumed_resources` are the resources used for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. This includes Cairo steps, builtins, syscalls, L1 messages, events, and state diffs during the `validate` and
`execute` stages.

[id="transaction_receipt"]
== Transaction receipt

The transaction receipt contains:

* Basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block).
* A summary of the execution resources used by the transaction.
* The events emitted .
* A list of messages sent to L1.
* A consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler).


The following is an example of a receipt:
