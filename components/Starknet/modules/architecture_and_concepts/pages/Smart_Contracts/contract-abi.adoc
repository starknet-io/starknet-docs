= Contract ABI

== Introduction

A contract ABI is a representation of a Starknet contract interface. It is formatted as JSON and describes the functions, structs and events which are defined in the contract.

You can get the contract's ABI by using `starknet-compile`:

[source,bash]
----
cargo run --bin starknet-compile -- --single-file </path/to/input.cairo> </path/to/output.json>

== Cairo v2.3.0 changes

=== Nested events

With Cairo `v2.3.0` the limitations on the `Event` enum have been relaxed, allowing more flexibility on the events that can be emitted from a given contract.

For example:

* It is no longer enforced that the `Event` enum variants are structs of the same name as the variant, they can now be a struct or an enum of any name.
* Enum variants inside event ABI entries (entries in the abi with `"type": "event"` and `"kind": "enum"`) now have two possible kinds. Before `v2.3.0` it was always `"kind": "nested"`, now `"kind: "flat"` is also possible.
* `v2.3.0` is backward compatible with version â‰¥ `2.0.0` ABI, so the same structure of the ABI is kept, while allowing flexibility.

[NOTE]
====
Between versions `v2.0.0` and `v2.2.0`, to identify all potential serializations of events (what raw `keys`, `data` arrays can be emitted given the ABI),
it was sufficient to iterate over the abi entries with `"type": "event"` and `"kind": "struct"`, skipping the encapsulating `Event` type which has `"kind": "enum"`.

With `v2.3.0` onwards, doing so may result in losing information.
====

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

```rust
//high-level code defining the events

#[event]
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
enum Event {
    ComponentEvent: test_component::Event,
    TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased,
    TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased,
    TestEnum: MyEnum
}

#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct CounterIncreased {
    amount: u128
}

#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct CounterDecreased {
    amount: u128
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Event)]
enum MyEnum {
  Var1: MyStruct
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)]
struct MyStruct {
	member: u128
}
```

=== Variant names different from types

In `v2.3.0` enum variant types can now have any name.

As an example the `TestCounterIncreased` variant and the `CounterIncreased` type, as they appear in the ABI:

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "name": "<namespace>::Event",
  "kind": "enum",
  "variants": [
      {
          "name": "ComponentEvent",
          "type": "<namespace>::test_component::Event",
          "kind": "nested"
      },
      {
          "name": "TestCounterIncreased",
          "type": "<namespace>::CounterIncreased",
          "kind": "nested"
      },
      {
          "name": "TestCounterDecreased",
          "type": "<namespace>::CounterDecreased",
          "kind": "nested"
      },
      {
          "name": "TestEnum",
          "type": "<namespace>::MyEnum",
          "kind": "nested"
      }
  ]
},
{
	"type": "event",
	"name": "<namespace>::CounterIncreased",
	"kind": "struct",
	"members": [
		{
			"name": "amount",
			"type": "core::integer::u128",
			"kind": "data"
		}
	]
}
```

When the contract emits the `TestCounterIncreased` event, for example by writing `self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount }))`, the event that is emitted has the following keys and data:

* One key based on the variant name: `sn_keccak(TestCounterIncreased)`. This information only appears in the `<namespace>::Event` type entry in the ABI,
as the name `TestCounterIncreased` does not appear in the `"kind": "struct"` ABI entry. This did not matter in previous versions when the variant name and type had to be equal.
* One data element based on the struct `CounterIncreased` which is associated with `TestCounterIncreased` via one of the `Event` type variants.

=== Enum variants inside Event

The introduction of components allows variants of `Event` to be enums.
In the following example, we have two such variants: `TestEnum` (unrelated to components) and `ComponentEvent`.

The serialization to keys and data is the same in both cases, so this example will focus on `TestEnum`:

This example shows the `TestEnum` variant entry inside Event:

```json
{
"name": "TestEnum",
"type": "<namespace>::MyEnum",
"kind": "nested"
}
```

This example shows the `MyEnum` event entry:

```json
{
	"type": "event",
	"name": "<namespace>::MyEnum",
	"kind": "enum",
	"variants": [
		{
			"name": "Var1",
			"type": "<namespace>::MyStruct",
			"kind": "nested"
		}
	]
}
```

This example shows the `MyStruct` event entry:

```json
{
	"type": "event",
	"name": "<namespace>::MyStruct",
	"kind": "struct",
	"members": [
		{
			"name": "member",
			"type": "core::integer::u128",
			"kind": "data"
		}
	]
}
```

[NOTE]
====
If a `TestEnum` event is being emitted via `self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(MyStruct {member: 5})))`, you can implement the trait `Into<MyStruct, Event>` to avoid having to write it out in full.
====

When the event is emitted, the serialization to keys and data happens as follows:

* Since the `TestEnum` variant has `kind` nested, add the first key: `sn_keccak(TestEnum)`, and the rest of the serialization to keys and data is done recursively via the `starknet::event` trait implementation of `MyEnum`.
* Next, you can handle a `"kind": "nested"` variant (previously it was `TestEnum`, now itâ€™s `Var1`), which means you can add another key depending on the sub-variant: `sn_keccak(Var1)`, and proceed to serialize according to the `starknet::event`
implementation of `MyStruct`.
* Finally, proceed to serialize `MyStruct`, which gives us a single data member.

This results in `keys = [sn_keccak(TestEnum), sn_keccak(Var1)]` and `data=[5]`

[NOTE]
====
Allowing variants that are themselves enums (`TestEnum` is an enum variant here) means further nesting is possible.
====


For example, if the high level code is changed to:

```rust
#[event]
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
enum Event {
    ComponentEvent: test_component::Event,
    TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased,
    TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased,
    TestEnum: MyEnum
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Event)]
enum MyEnum {
    Var1: AnotherEnum
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)]
enum AnotherEnum {
    Var2: MyStruct
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)]
struct MyStruct {
    member: u128,
}

```

then `self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(AnotherEnum::Var2(MyStruct { member: 5 }))))`
(as before, `Into` implementations can shorten this) will emit an event with `keys = [sn_keccak(TestEnum), sn_keccak(Var1), sn_keccak(Var2)]` and `data=[5]`.

This will look as follows in the ABI (only the relevant parts are shown):

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "name": "<namespace>::Event",
  "kind": "enum",
  "variants": [
    // ignoring all the other variants for brevity
    {
      "name": "TestEnum",
      "type": "<namespace>::MyEnum",
      "kind": "nested"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "type": "event",
  "name": "<namespace>::MyEnum",
  "kind": "enum",
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Var1",
      "type": "<namespace>::AnotherEnum",
      "kind": "nested"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "type": "event",
  "name": "<namespace>::AnotherEnum",
  "kind": "enum",
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Var2",
      "type": "<namespace>::MyStruct",
      "kind": "nested"
    }
  ]
}
```

As `TestEnum`, `Var1` and `Var2` are of kind `nested`, a selector should be added to the list of keys, before continuing to recursively serialize.

=== Flattened enum variants

You might not want to nest enums when serializing the event. For example, if you write an ERC-20 as a component, not a contract, that is pluggable anywhere, you might not want the contract to modify the keys of known events such as `Transfer`.

To avoid nesting, write the following high level code:

```rust
#[event]
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
enum Event {
	ComponentEvent: test_component::Event,
	TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased,
	TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased,
	#[flat]
	TestEnum: MyEnum
}
```

By writing the above, the `TestEnum` variant entry in the ABI will change to:

```json
{
"name": "TestEnum",
"type": "<namespace>::MyEnum",
"kind": "flat"
}
```

This means that `self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(MyStruct {member: 5})))` will emit an event with `keys=[sn_keccak(Var1)]` and `data=[5]`.


== Cairo v2.0.0 changes

With the transition to `v2.0.0`, the contract ABI underwent some changes.

Consider the following high level code that generates the ABI in the following example:

[source, rust]
----
#[starknet::interface]
trait IOtherContract<TContractState> {
    fn decrease_allowed(self: @TContractState) -> bool;
}

#[starknet::interface]
trait ICounterContract<TContractState> {
    fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128);
    fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128);
    fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128;
}

#[starknet::contract]
mod counter_contract {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use super::{
        IOtherContractDispatcher, IOtherContractDispatcherTrait, IOtherContractLibraryDispatcher
    };

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        counter: u128,
        other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        CounterIncreased: CounterIncreased,
        CounterDecreased: CounterDecreased
    }

    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    struct CounterIncreased {
        amount: u128
    }

    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    struct CounterDecreased {
        amount: u128
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState, initial_counter: u128, other_contract_addr: ContractAddress
    ) {
        self.counter.write(initial_counter);
        self
            .other_contract
            .write(IOtherContractDispatcher { contract_address: other_contract_addr });
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    impl CounterContract of super::ICounterContract<ContractState> {
        fn get_counter(self: @ContractState) -> u128 {
            self.counter.read()
        }

        fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) {
            let current = self.counter.read();
            self.counter.write(current + amount);
            self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount });
        }

        fn decrease_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) {
            let allowed = self.other_contract.read().decrease_allowed();
            if allowed {
                let current = self.counter.read();
                self.counter.write(current - amount);
                self.emit(CounterDecreased { amount });
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Interface and Impl ABI entries

Since the `CounterContract` `impl` is annotated with the `#[external(v0)]` attribute, you'll find the following `impl` entry in the ABI:

```
{
  "type": "impl",
  "name": "CounterContract",
  "interface_name": "new_syntax_test_contract::new_syntax_test_contract::ICounterContract"
}
```

This means that every function appearing in the `ICounterContract` interface 
is a possible entry point of the contract.

[NOTE]
====
Standalone functions in the contract outside an external `impl` can also be annotated with `#[external(v0)]` (currently, this is the only way to add L1 handlers). In such cases, a corresponding `function` (or `l1_handler`) entry will be found in
the ABI in the same hierarchy as `impls` and interfaces.
====

=== Events

In Cairo v2, a dedicated type for the contract's events was introduced. Currently, the contract event type must be an enum named `Event`, whose variants are structs of the same name as the variant. Types that can be emitted via `self.emit(_)` must implement the `Event` link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/7144f2f383961cbca4804a7d056d48973721446c/corelib/src/starknet/event.cairo#L4[trait], which defines how this type should be serialized into two `felt252` arrays, `keys` and `data`.

The `Event` enum variants appear in the ABI under `"type" = "event"` rather than regular structs.

For such entries, each member has an additional `kind` field that specifies how the serialization into keys and data takes place:

* If the kind is `key`, then this member or variant are serialized into the event's keys.
* If the kind is `data`, then this member or variant are serialized into the event's data.
* If the kind is `nested`, then the member or variant are serialized according to the `Event` attribute, potentially adding to both keys and data.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is not yet supported, so no high level code written in Cairo `v2.0.0` can generate such an ABI.
