= Contract Classes

Taking inspiration from object-oriented programming, Starknet distinguishes between a contract and its implementation by separating contracts into classes and instances.

A contract class is the definition of the contract: Cairo byte code, hint information, entry point names, and everything that defines its semantics unambiguously.

Each class is identified by its xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/class-hash.adoc[class hash], which is analogous
to a class
name in an
object-oriented programming language. A contract instance is a deployed contract corresponding to a class.

Notice that only contract instances behave as contracts in that they have their own storage and
can be called by transactions or other contracts. A contract class does not necessarily have a deployed instance in Starknet.

== Using Classes

New classes can be added to the state of Starknet with the xref:architecture_and_concepts:Network_Architecture/Blocks/transactions.adoc#declare-transaction[`declare`] transaction. New instances of a previously declared class
can be deployed via the xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/system-calls-cairo1.adoc#deploy[`deploy`]
system call.

To use the functionality of a declared class, without deploying an instance of that class, you
can use the xref:architecture_and_concepts:Smart_Contracts/system-calls-cairo1.adoc#library_call[`library_call`] system call. This system call is an
analogue of Ethereum's delegate
call in the world of classes. You can use class code directly, instead of having a placeholder contract deployed, which is used only for its code.
