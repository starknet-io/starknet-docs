= Deploying new accounts

Starknet provides the `deploy_account` transaction in order to deploy new accounts to the
network.

== Deploy account transaction

In order to deploy a new account on StarkNet you need to complete the following steps:

. Decide on the account contract that you want to deploy.
. Compute your offchain account address.
. Send funds to this address.

. When the address has enough funds to pay for the deployment, send a _Deploy account_ transaction.

== Transaction flow

Upon receiving a `deploy_account` transaction, the sequencer will:

* Verify that the address has funds to pay for the deployment
* Execute the constructor with the given arguments
* Execute the `+__validate_deploy__+` entry point (See below)
* Charge fee from the new account address
* Advance the nonce to 1

== Validate deploy

Two issues might arise from sending a `deploy_account` transaction without any extra validation:

* Sequencers having the ability to charge arbitrarily high fees, thus potentially draining user funds from a pre-funded account
* A bad actor having the ability to carry out a sequencer DOS attack by sending multiple, invalid `deploy_account` transactions. This would result in the sequencer not being compensated for work completed.


To prevent the scenario described in the first point, a new optional validation entrypoint is provided: `+__validate_deploy__+`.

The following limitations on the constructor and `+__validate_deploy__+` executions prevent a potential DoS attack from the second point:

* Limited number of Cairo steps.
* Limited number of builtin applications.
* No external contract calls. Library calls and self-calls are allowed.

This entrypoint should be included in any accounts or contracts that wish to allow this new deployment flow.

=== Using validate deploy

`+__validate_deploy__+` expects the following arguments:

* class hash
* contract address salt
* constructor arguments - the arguments expected by the contract’s constructor (this will be enforced in the compiler).

[NOTE]
====
In determining the contract address, deployer address 0 will be used.
====

Consider an account with the following constructor signature:

[#constructor_signature]
[source,cairo]
----
@constructor
func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    _public_key: felt
)
----

Then the signature of `+__validate_deploy__+` must be:

[#call_validate_deploy]
[source,cairo,sub="quotes"]
----
func __validate_deploy__{
    syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr, ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin*
}(class_hash: felt, contract_address_salt: felt, _public_key: felt)
----

[NOTE]
====
The transaction hash and `max_fee` are accessible through the `get_tx_info` system call.
