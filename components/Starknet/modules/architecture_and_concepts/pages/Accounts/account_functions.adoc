[id="account_interface_functions"]
= Account interface function reference

== Overview

The functions in the table xref:#starknet_account_interface_functions[] are part of account contracts. Where required, you must include these functions within your contract. The logic of these functions can be mostly arbitrary, with a few limitations. For information on these limitations, see xref:#invalid_transactions[].

| Function name | When required

| `+__validate__+` | Always required
| `+__execute__+` | Always required
| `+__validate_declare__+` | Required for a contract to be able to send a `DECLARE` transaction.
| `+__validate_deploy__+` | Required when deploying an account with a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` _transaction_.
| constructor | If an account does not define a constructor function, the sequencer uses a default constructor function, which is empty.
|===

When the sequencer receives a transaction request, it calls the corresponding validation function with the fields of the transaction request. For an `INVOKE` transaction, after successfully completing validation, the sequencer calls the `+__execute__+` function with the fields of the transaction request.

* For more information on the available transaction types and their fields, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Network_Architecture/transactions.adoc[Transaction types].
* For more information on the validation and execution stages, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Network_Architecture/transaction-life-cycle.adoc[Transaction lifecycle].

Separating the validation and execution stages guarantees payment to sequencers for work completed and protects them from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

[#attacks_that_validation_limitations_prevent]
== Potential attacks

The validation functions have limitations, described below, that are designed to prevent the following attacks:

* Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Without these limitations, an attack could cause the sequencer to perform a large amount of work before a transaction fails validation, such as by sending multiple `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transactions that are invalid as a result of the constructor or `+__validate_deploy__+` failing. This work would not be eligible for fee payment.
* Even if the validation is simple, the following attack could still be possible:
. An attacker fills the mempool with transactions that are valid at the time they are sent.
. A sequencer starts executing them, thinking that by the time it produces a block, they will still be valid.
. However, shortly after the transactions are sent, the attacker sends one transaction that somehow invalidates all the previous ones and makes sure it's included in the block, by offering higher fees for this one transaction, before the sequencer can publish the block.
* Consider many validation functions checking that the value of a storage slot is `1`, and the attacker's transaction later sets it to `0`. Restricting validation functions from calling external contracts prevents this attack.

[#limitations_of_validation]
== Limitations on validation that prevent attacks

The limitations listed here apply to the following validation functions:

* `+__validate__+`, `+__validate_deploy__+`, and `+__validate_declare__+`
* A constructor, when run in a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction. That is, if an account is deployed from an existing class via the `deploy` syscall, the constructor can run differently. #Isn't  this scenario run in an `INVOKE` transaction?#

The validation functions have the following limitations:

* You cannot call functions in external contracts, only in your account contract.
+
[NOTE]
====
This restriction enforces a single storage update being able to invalidate only transactions from a single account. However, be aware that an account can always invalidate its own past transactions by changing its keys.

So the fees you need to pay to invalidate transactions in the mempool are directly proportional to the number of unique accounts. For example, if the fee you need to pay to invalidate a transaction from one account is stem:[$$x$$], then the price of invalidating ten transactions from ten different accounts is stem:[$$10x$$].
====

* The maximum number of computational steps, measured in Cairo steps, for a validation function is 1,000,000.
* A builtin can be applied a limited number of times. #What's the limit?#
* Access is restricted to `sequencer_address` in the `get_execution_info` syscall. The syscall returns zero values for `sequencer_address`.
* The following syscalls cannot be called:
** `get_block_hash`
** `get_sequencer_address` `get_sequencer_address` is only supported for Cairo 0 contracts.

[NOTE]
====
#Is this note obsolete?#

Validation, while now abstract and in control of the account owner rather than the protocol, should still be a simple operation. So in the future, the `+__validate__+` function will have a limitation of a maximum number of Cairo steps.
====

[id="invalid_transactions"]
== Invalid transactions

When the `+__validate__+`, `+__validate_deploy__+`, or `+__validate_declare__+`, function fails, the account in question does not pay any fee.

#Is the transaction reverted?#

[id="reverted_transactions"]
== Reverted transactions

A transaction has the status *REVERTED* when the `+__execute__+` function fails. A reverted transaction is included in a block, and the sequencer is eligible to charge a fee for the work done up to the point of failure, similar to Ethereum.

== Function descriptions

The functions in this section must be present in account contracts, as noted, with `+__execute__+` and `+__validate__+` required in all account contracts. However, you define the logic in the these functions as needed, unless noted otherwise, while adhering to the limitations specified in xref:#limitations_of_validation[]. As a result, the function descriptions below leave you room to define your own functionality.

For examples of account contracts that implement these functions, see link:https://book.starknet.io/ch04-01-accounts.html[Account Contracts] in the Starknet Book.


[id="__execute__"]
=== `+__execute__+`

.Description

_Always required_

Initiates the execution stage in the sequencer. The sequencer calls this function upon receiving an `INVOKE` transaction, after the `+__validate__+` function successfully completes.

In most implementations, `+__execute__+` initiates a sequence of calls from the account.

The purpose of the `+__execute__+` function is to abstract away the remaining actions performed by a transaction.

In Ethereum, a transaction is necessarily a call to a specific function in a smart contract. With the `+__execute__+` abstraction, the account designer controls the flow of the transaction. For example, you can natively support multicalls in your account, saving the need to send multiple transactions. In practice, however, #this# is even harder to manage without multicalls due to nonces. #What does _this_ refer to? Sending multiple transactions?#

.Returns

The list of each call's serialized return value.


'''

[id="__validate__"]
=== `+__validate__+`

.Description

_Always required_

Initiates the validation stage in the sequencer. Validates the sender's address. The sequencer calls this function upon receiving any transaction.

In most implementations, `+__validate__+` ensures that only the account owner can initiate transactions.


The `+__validate__+` function typically ensures that any transaction submitted was indeed initiated by the account owner and therefore does not take up unjustified resources during the execution process.


Without this mechanism, a forged transaction could result in the sequencer stealing the user's funds. So the `+__validate__+` function ensures that the sequencer can only include transactions that were approved by the account owner.

The arbitrary logic allowed in the `+__validate__+` function gives the account's designer the ability to determine what it means for a transaction to be valid, enabling different signature schemes and other xref:architecture_and_concepts:Accounts/introduction.adoc#examples[exotic accounts].

.Returns

If the signature is verified, the function should return the string `VALID` as `felt252` value. If not, it should return any other value, such as `0`.


'''

[id="__validate_declare__"]
=== `+__validate_declare__+`

.Description

_Required for a contract to be able to send a_ `DECLARE` _transaction._

The sequencer calls this function upon receiving a `DECLARE` transaction.

If the contract declares other contracts and handles the corresponding gas fees, this function authenticates the contract declaration.

.Parameters

[horizontal,labelwidth="35",role="stripes-odd"]
`class_hash: _felt_`:: The class hash.

.Returns

If the signature is verified, the function should return the string `VALID` as `felt252` value. If not, it should return any other value, such as `0`.



'''

[id="__validate_deploy__"]
=== `+__validate_deploy__+`

.Description

_Required when deploying an account with a_ `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` _transaction_.

The sequencer calls this function upon receiving a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction. Validates the deployment of the class referred to by the `class_hash` parameter in the transaction.

You can use this function to set up an account contract without linking it to the address that deploys it or depending on another account contract for gas fees. When determining the contract's address, use the deployer address `0x0`.

.Parameters

[horizontal,labelwidth="35",role="stripes-odd"]
`class_hash: _felt_`:: The class hash.
`contract_address_salt: _felt_`:: The contract address salt.
`<__constructor_arguments__>`:: The arguments expected by the contract’s constructor. The inputs to the constructor must be identical to the rest of the inputs for validate_deploy. The compiler enforces this requirement.

[NOTE]
====
In determining the contract address, the deployer address `0x0` is used.
====

.Returns

If the signature is verified, the function should return the string `VALID` as a `felt252` value. If not, it should return any other value, such as `0`.

.Example

Notice how the signature of `+__validate_deploy__+` is structured to consider the signature of the constructor:

[#call_validate_deploy]
[source,cairo,sub="quotes"]
----
  fn __validate_deploy__(
      self: @ComponentState<TContractState>,
      class_hash: felt252,
      contract_address_salt: felt252,
      public_key: felt252
  ) -> felt252

#[constructor]
fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, public_key: felt252)
----

[NOTE]
====
You can access the transaction hash and value for `max_fee` by getting transaction information with the `get_execution_info` system call.
