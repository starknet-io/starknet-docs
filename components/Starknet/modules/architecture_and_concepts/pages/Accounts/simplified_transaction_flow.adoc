= Simplified transaction flow

The key stages of transaction lifetime are:

.   The sequencer selects a transaction from the mempool and executes `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate&lowbar;&lowbar;`
.   If the transaction was valid, the `&lowbar;&lowbar;execute&lowbar;&lowbar;` function is called
.   If `&lowbar;&lowbar;execute&lowbar;&lowbar;` ran successfully, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block, charges the fee and proceeds to work on the next transaction (once the block is concluded, it will be sent to the prover)

== The payment mechanism

The sequencer receives fees in ETH in return for including transactions in a block.

For more details on how the transaction fee is computed, see xref:../Network_Architecture/fee-mechanism.adoc[the fees section]
