[id="starknet_account_structure"]
= Starknet's account interface

Starknet's account structure is inspired by Ethereum's EIP-4337, where instead of EOAs, you use smart contract accounts with arbitrary verification logic.

While not mandatory at the protocol level, you can use a richer standard interface for accounts, defined in link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-6.md[Starknet Improvement Proposal #6 (SNIP-6)]. SNIP-6 was developed by community members at OpenZeppelin, in close collaboration with wallet teams and other Core Starknet developers.

[#account_functions]
== Account functions

A valid account contract includes specific functions, depending on the type of the contract. For more information, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Accounts/account_functions.adoc[].

[#replay_protection]
== Replay protection

In Starknet, similar to Ethereum, every contract has a nonce, including an account contract. This nonce is sequential. The nonce of a transaction sent from an account must match the nonce of that account. After the transaction is executed, whether or not it is reverted, the nonce is incremented by one.

[NOTE]
====
In Starknet, only the nonce of account contracts, that is, those adhering to the above structure, can be non-zero.

In contrast, in Ethereum, regular smart contracts, known as _Contract Accounts_, as opposed to _Externally Owned Accounts_ can increment their nonce by deploying smart contracts, that is, executing the `CREATE` and `CREATE2` opcodes.

For more information on accounts in Ethereum, see link:https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/[Ethereum Accounts] in the Ethereum documentation.
====

A nonce serves two important roles:

* It guarantees transaction hash uniqueness, which is important for a good user experience.
* It provides replay protection to the account: Because the signature is bound to a particular nonce, a malicious party cannot replay the transaction.

Starknet currently determines the nonce structure at the protocol level to be sequential. In the future, Starknet will consider a more flexible design, extending account abstraction to nonce management, previously referred to as _nonce abstraction_.
