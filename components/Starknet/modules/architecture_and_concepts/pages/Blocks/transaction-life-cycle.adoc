== Transaction flow

The transaction lifecycle in Starknet involves the following high level steps:

=== 1. Transaction Submission
A transaction is submitted to one of the gateways, functioning as the Mempool and marks the transaction status as `RECEIVED`.

=== 2. Validation
The Mempool performs validation on the transaction to check for its validity. If the transaction is invalid, it will not proceed to the next stages.

=== 3. Execution
The sequencer operation sequentially applies the validated transactions to the state. If a transaction fails during execution, it will be included in the block with the status `REVERTED`.

=== 4. Proof Generation
The Prover stage executes the operating system on the new block, computes the proof, and transmits it to L1.



[id="transaction_status"]
== Transaction status

The following are the possible statuses of a transaction from the moment it's sent by the user to the moment it's validated by L1.

[id="not_received"]
=== NOT_RECEIVED

The transaction is not yet known to the sequencer.

[id="received"]
=== RECEIVED

The transaction was received by the mempool. The transaction will now either execute successfully or be rejected.

[id="accepted_on_l2"]
=== ACCEPTED_ON_L2

The transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2.

[id="accepted_on_l1"]
=== ACCEPTED_ON_L1

The transaction was accepted on-chain.

[id="rejected"]
=== REJECTED

The transaction was received by the Mempool but failed validation in the sequencer. Such transactions will not be included in a block.

[id="reverted"]
=== REVERTED

The transaction passed validation but failed during execution in the sequencer. They will be included in the block with the status `REVERTED`.

[[transaction-state-implications]]
== State Implications of a `REVERTED` Transaction

When a transaction is marked as `REVERTED`, the following state implications occur:

Nonce increases:: The nonce value for the account of the failed transaction will increase despite the failure.

Fee charge:: A fee will be charged for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure.

Partial Reversion:: All changes that occurred during the `validate` stage are not reverted. However, all changes that occurred during the `execute` stage are reverted, including no messages to L1 or events.

Fee Calculation:: The fee charged for `REVERTED` transactions will be calculated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
fee = Min(max_fee, consumed_resources) * configurable_factor
----
where the `configurable_factor` will be 1.

Consumed Resources:: The `consumed_resources` are the resources used for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. This includes Cairo steps, builtins, syscalls, L1 messages, events, and state diffs during the `validate` and
`execute` stages.

[id="transaction_receipt"]
== Transaction receipt

The transaction receipt contains:

* Basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block).
* A summary of the execution resources used by the transaction.
* The events emitted .
* A list of messages sent to L1.
* A consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler).


The following is an example of a receipt:
