= The STARK field

// The field element type in Starknet is based on the STARK field in the underlying Cairo VM. In other words, a value stem:[$$x$$] of a field element type is an integer in the range of stem:[$$0≤x<P$$].

The _STARK field_ is the finite field stem:[\mathbb{F}_P], where stem:[$$P$$] is a prime number, calculated as follows:

[stem]
++++
P = 2^{251} + 17*2^{192} + 1
++++

The Cairo VM uses the STARK field, referred to as a field element, or _felt_. The `felt252` type in Cairo refers to elements of this field.
