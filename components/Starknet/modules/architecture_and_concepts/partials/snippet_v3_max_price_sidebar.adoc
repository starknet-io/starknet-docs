.v3 Transactions
v3 transactions use `max_amount` and `max_price_per_unit` to set the maximum amount of a resource that can be used on L1,
//or L2 (UNCOMMENT WHEN THIS IS ENABLED IN STARKNET).
and the maximum price per unit of that resource that the user is willing to pay. These fields replace the `max_fee` field.

[IMPORTANT]
====
At the time of writing, the only resource involved is the marginal verification cost of the transaction, measured in units of L1 gas. An additional resource,`L2_GAS` will be added in the future.
