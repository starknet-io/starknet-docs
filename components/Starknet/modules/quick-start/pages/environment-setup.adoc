= Setting up your Starknet development environment

== Introduction

Welcome to the first installment of the "Hello, Starknet!" quistart series, the official tutorial for starting your journey as a Starknet developer! ðŸš€

As a popular phrase (often attributed to Abraham Lincoln) says, "Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe". The first installment of the series will therefore guide you through setting up your development environment, which will include the three most recommended tools to begin developing on Starknet:

* _Scarb_, a build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet ecosystems.

* _Starknet Foundry_, the go-to framework for building and testing Starknet Smart Contracts

* _Starkli_, a command-line interface that allows you to interact with Starknet.

== Installing Scarb and Starknet Foundry

=== MacOS and Linux

It is highly recommended to install both Scarb and Starknet Foundry on MacOS and Linux via the link:https://asdf-vm.com/[`asdf` version manager], as it allows to easily switch between their different versions, both globally and per project (see full details in the link:https://asdf-vm.com/manage/commands.html[`asdf` documentation] or by running `asdf --help`).

.Procedure

. Verify that `asdf` is installed:
+
[source,console]
----
$ asdf --version
----
+
or install it by following the instructions in the link:https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html[`asdf` documentation].

. Install the `asdf` Scarb and Starknet Foundry plugins:
+
[source,console]
----
$ asdf plugin add scarb
$ asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
----

. Install the latest versions of Scarb and Starknet Foundry:
+
[source,console]
----
$ asdf install scarb latest
$ asdf install starknet-foundry latest
----

. Set global versions for Scarb and Starknet Foundry (need for using `scarb init`):
+
[source,console]
----
$ asdf global scarb latest
$ asdf global starknet-foundry latest
----

. Restart the terminal and verify that Scarb and Starknet Foundry are installed correctly:
+
[source,console]
----
$ scarb --version
$ snforge --version
$ sncast --version
----

=== Windows

Both Scarb's and Starknet Foundry's installation on Windows requires manual setup.

.Procedure

. Follow the instructions in the link:https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#windows[Scarb documentation] and https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation-on-windows[Starknet Foundry documentation]

. Restart the terminal and verify that Scarb is installed correctly:
+
[source,console]
----
$ scarb --version
$ snforge --version
$ sncast --version
----

[#installing-starkli]
== Installing Starkli

=== MacOS and Linux

It is highly recommended to install Starkli on MacOS and Linux using the link:https://get.starkli.sh[`starkliup` portable script]. `starkliup` manages shell configuration for you, and using any other installation method requires to link:https://book.starkli.rs/shell-completions[manually set up shell completions].

.Procedure

. Download `starkliup`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh
----

. Restart the terminal and install Starkli:
+
[source,console]
----
$ starkliup
----

. Restart the terminal and verify that Starkli is installed correctly:
+
[source,console]
----
$ starkli --version
----

=== Windows

Starknet Foundry's installation on Windows requires manually setting up shell completions.

.Procedure

. Install Starkli:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli
----

. Restart the terminal and verify that Starkli is installed correctly:
+
[source,console]
----
$ starkli --version
----
+

. Set up Starkli's shell completions by following the instructions in the link:https://book.starkli.rs/shell-completions[Starkli documentation].

== Setting up an RPC provider

In order to interact with Starknet, an RPC endpoint is required. For interactions with Starknet Sepolia and Starknet mainnet, Starkli supports default (and limited) RPC endpoints when using the `--network` flag. For demonstration purposes, this guide uses Starkli's default Starknet Sepolia RPC endpoint by setting `--network=sepolia` whenever interacting with Starknet.

[TIP]
====
Configuring a custom RPC endpoint can be done by either using Starkli's `--rpc` flag or setting up Starkli's `STARKNET_RPC` environment variable (see more details in the https://book.starkli.rs/providers#using-an-rpc-url-directly[Starkli documentation]). To review all Starknet RPC providers, see xref:tools:api-services.adoc[API providers].
