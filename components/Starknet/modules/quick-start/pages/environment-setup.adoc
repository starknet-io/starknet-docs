== Overview

In order to use Starknet, you need to install several tools. This section will walk you through installing the three most recommended tools to begin developing on Starknet:

* xref:tools:devtools/clis.adoc#starkli[Starkli], a command-line interface that allows you to interact with Starknet.

* xref:tools:devtools/smart-contract-tools.adoc#scarb[Scarb], a build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet ecosystems.

* xref:tools:devtools/smart-contract-tools.adoc#starknet_foundry[Starknet Foundry], the go-to framework for building and testing Starknet Smart Contracts

To review all Starknet developer tools, check out the xref:tools:devtools/overview.adoc[tools and resources section].
