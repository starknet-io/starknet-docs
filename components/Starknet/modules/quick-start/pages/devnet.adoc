= Declaring, deploying, and interacting with the `HelloStarknet` contract locally

include::partial$snippet-important-troubleshooting.adoc[]

== Introduction

Welcome to the third installment of the "Hello, Starknet!" quickstart series, the official tutorial for starting your journey as a Starknet developer! ðŸš€

Local networks, also known as development networks or _devnets_, enable a fast and private development process, making them ideal for taking your first Starknet steps. This installment of the series will therefore guide you through the steps necessary to declare, deploy, and interact with the `HelloStarknet` contract on your very own local instance of Starknet.

== Initializing a local Starknet instance

A local Starknet instance can be easily initialized using Starknet Devnet by simply running:

[source,terminal]
----
starknet-devnet --seed=0
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--seed` option is used to force consistent addresses of predeployed account (see more details below).
====

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
Predeployed FeeToken
ETH Address: 0x49D36570D4E46F48E99674BD3FCC84644DDD6B96F7C741B1562B82F9E004DC7

== Fetching a predeployed account

[TIP]
====
To learn more about Starknet accounts, check out the xref:architecture-and-concepts:accounts/introduction.adoc[Accounts section].
====

To interact with your local Starknet instance, you first need an account. Luckily, the result of initializing a local Starknet instance using Starknet Devnet should also include a list of predeployed accounts that resembles the following:

[source,terminal]
----
| Account address |  0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691
| Private key     |  0x0000000000000000000000000000000071d7bb07b9a64f6f78ac4c816aff4da9
| Public key      |  0x039d9e6ce352ad4530a0ef5d5a18fd3303c3606a7fa6ac5b620020ad681cc33b

| Account address |  0x078662e7352d062084b0010068b99288486c2d8b914f6e2a55ce945f8792c8b1
| Private key     |  0x000000000000000000000000000000000e1406455b7d66b1690803be066cbe5e
| Public key      |  0x007a1bb2744a7dd29bffd44341dbd78008adb4bc11733601e7eddff322ada9cb

...
----

This allows to avoid creating and deploying new accounts, and instead simply importing them to Starknet Foundry. To import your local node's first predeployed account, navigate into the `hello_starknet` directory created in xref:hellostarknet.adoc#generating_hellostarknet[Generating `HelloStarknet`] and run:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast account import \
    --address=0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691 \
    --type=oz \
    --url=http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --private-key=0x0000000000000000000000000000000071d7bb07b9a64f6f78ac4c816aff4da9 \
    --add-profile=devnet \
    --silent
----

[TIP]
====
To learn more about `sncast account import`, see the https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/appendix/sncast/account/import.html[Starknet Foundry documentation^].
====

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: account import
account_name: account-1
add_profile: Profile devnet successfully added to snfoundry.toml
----

== Declaring `HelloStarknet` locally

Before a contract can be deployed on Starknet, its compiled code needs to be submitted to the network (also known as _declaring_ it).

[TIP]
====
To learn more about distinction between deploying a contract and declaring it, see xref:architecture-and-concepts:smart-contracts/contract-classes.adoc[].
====

To declare the `HelloStarknet` contract, run:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --profile=devnet declare \
    --contract-name=HelloStarknet
----

If successful, the output of the declaration should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
command: declare
class_hash: 0x044701b93b7d2c072d37ebed1f2955f77472146fb0fbac158bd860426f72a9d6
transaction_hash: 0x0687bfb07896505bf44ea65c71d11a847ab33a52cb3abf3322b5107a2f256111
...
----

where `class_hash` is the contract's class hash, which can then be used to deploy an instance of it.

[TIP]
====
To learn more about the class hashes, check out xref:architecture-and-concepts:smart-contracts/compiled-class-hash.adoc[Compiled class hash].
====

== Deploying `HelloStarknet` locally

With `HelloStarknet` declared, you can now deploy an instance of it by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --profile=devnet deploy \
    --class-hash=0x044701b93b7d2c072d37ebed1f2955f77472146fb0fbac158bd860426f72a9d6 \
    --salt=0
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--salt` option is used to force a consistent address for the deployed contract.
====

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: deploy
contract_address: 0x071865534dda7487b6c7b73d435e1f41d3fd41f6d3c4fcf4448f9770677f820d
transaction_hash: 0x00eb383d6cd4b760369198a3025321084249c4fbdfe1038f774062d4b1d47fed
...

== Interacting with `HelloStarknet` locally

Now that your instance of `HelloStarknet` is deployed, you can interact with via its functions by either calling or invoking them.

Calling is used for read functions that don't modify their contract's storage, and allows querying a smart contract function without sending a transaction. For example, you can call ``HelloStarknet``'s `get_balance` function by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --profile=devnet call \
    --contract-address=0x071865534dda7487b6c7b73d435e1f41d3fd41f6d3c4fcf4448f9770677f820d \
    --function=get_balance
----

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
command: call
response: [0x0]
----

Invoking is used for write functions that modify their contract's storage, and submits a transaction to the network that changes its state. For example, you can invoke ``HelloStarknet``'s `increase_balance` function by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --profile=devnet invoke \
    --contract-address=0x071865534dda7487b6c7b73d435e1f41d3fd41f6d3c4fcf4448f9770677f820d \
    --function=increase_balance \
    --arguments=42
----

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: invoke
transaction_hash: 0x069679d0cf21851b299ef24fcdae7478cea6e730432365b6eef1f4f280ba68da
----

You can verify that your deployed contract's storage â€” and by extension, the state of your local Starknet instance â€” has indeed changed by calling `get_balance` again. If all goes well, the result should resemble the following (`42~10~ = 2a~16~`):

[source,console]
----
command: call
response: [0x2a]
----
