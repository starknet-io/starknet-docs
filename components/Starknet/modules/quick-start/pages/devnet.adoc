= Declaring, deploying, and interacting with the `HelloStarknet` contract locally

== Introduction

Welcome to the third installment of the "Hello, Starknet!" quickstart series, the official tutorial for starting your journey as a Starknet developer! ðŸš€

Local networks, also known as development networks or _devnets_, enable a fast and private development process, making them ideal for taking your first Starknet steps. This installment of the series will therefore guide you through the steps necessary to declare, deploy, and interact with the `HelloStarknet` contract on your very own local instance of Starknet.

== Initializing a local Starknet instance

A local Starknet instance can be easily initialized using Starknet Devent by simply running:

[source,terminal]
----
starknet-devnet --seed=0
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--seed` option is used to force consistent addresses of predeployed account (see more details below).
====

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----

== Fetching a predeployed account

[TIP]
====
To learn more about Starknet accounts, check out the xref:architecture-and-concepts:accounts/introduction.adoc[Accounts section].
====

To interact with your local Starknet instance, you first need an account. Luckily, the result of initializing a local Starknet instance using Starknet Devnet should also include a list of predeployed accounts that resembles the following:

[source,terminal]
----
| Account address |  0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691
| Private key     |  0x0000000000000000000000000000000071d7bb07b9a64f6f78ac4c816aff4da9
| Public key      |  0x039d9e6ce352ad4530a0ef5d5a18fd3303c3606a7fa6ac5b620020ad681cc33b

| Account address |  0x078662e7352d062084b0010068b99288486c2d8b914f6e2a55ce945f8792c8b1
| Private key     |  0x000000000000000000000000000000000e1406455b7d66b1690803be066cbe5e
| Public key      |  0x007a1bb2744a7dd29bffd44341dbd78008adb4bc11733601e7eddff322ada9cb

...
----

This allows to avoid creating and deploying new accounts, and instead simply fetching them into Starkli. To fetch your local node's first predeployed account, run:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli account fetch \
    0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691 \
    --output=account.json \
    --rpc=http://127.0.0.1:5050
----

[NOTE]
====
`http://127.0.0.1:5050` are the local node's default host and port (which can be configured on initialization using the `--host` and `--port` options).
====

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
Account contract type identified as: OpenZeppelin
Description: OpenZeppelin account contract v0.8.1 compiled with cairo v2.4.1
Downloaded new account config file: account.json
----

To finish setting up the account, a corresponding Starkli signer, used by Starkli to sign transactions, is also required.  In this tutorial, we will use an encrypted keystores signer. Encrypted keystores are JSON files that follow the https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/web3-secret-storage/[Web3 secret storage definition] and require a password when created and used, preventing  your private key from being stored as plain text on your computer. To create an encrypted keystore signer for your fetched account, run:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli signer keystore from-key keystore.json
----

and enter `0x0000000000000000000000000000000071d7bb07b9a64f6f78ac4c816aff4da9` as its private key, along with a password of your choosing that will be used to encrypt it. If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
Created new encrypted keystore file: keystore.json
Public key: 0x039d9e6ce352ad4530a0ef5d5a18fd3303c3606a7fa6ac5b620020ad681cc33b
----


To avoid specifying the account and keystore files in every subsequent Starkli command, export their paths by running:

[source,terminal]
----
export STARKNET_ACCOUNT=$(pwd)/account.json
export STARKNET_KEYSTORE=$(pwd)/keystore.json
----

== Declaring `HelloStarknet` locally


To declare the `HelloStarknet` contract, navigate into the `hello_starknet` directory created in xref:compiling-hellostarknet.adoc[Compiling the `HelloStarknet` contract], run:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli declare \
    target/dev/hello_starknet_HelloStarknet.contract_class.json \
    --rpc=http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
----

and enter your password. If successful, the output of the declaration should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
...

----

where `Class hash declared` is the contract's class hash, which can then be used to deploy an instance of it.

[NOTE]
====
Class hashes are unique per contract and compiler, and may change if either one changes. To learn more about the class hashes, check out xref:architecture-and-concepts:smart-contracts/compiled-class-hash.adoc[Compiled class hash].
====

== Deploying `HelloStarknet` locally

With `HelloStarknet` declared, you can now deploy an instance of it by running:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli deploy \
    0x0785c92bf4aa7a89fb62371802aef2f58e2333d8df7e2aadf938efa83735431c \
    --rpc=http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --salt=0
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--salt` option is used to force a consistent address for the deployed contract.
====

and entering your password. If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
Deploying class 0x0785c92bf4aa7a89fb62371802aef2f58e2333d8df7e2aadf938efa83735431c with salt 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...

0x02ceb6da76e2b2b80f2a23ff2910edf1dcc12e1b9d6a27d1da43d7db943e568c
----

== Interacting with `HelloStarknet` locally

Now that your instance of `HelloStarknet` is deployed, you can interact with via its functions. Starkli enables interaction with smart contracts via two primary commands, `invoke` and `call`.

The `call` command is used for read functions that don't modify their contract's storage, and allows querying a smart contract function without sending a transaction. For example, you can call ``HelloStarknet``'s `get_balance` function by running:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli call \
    0x02ceb6da76e2b2b80f2a23ff2910edf1dcc12e1b9d6a27d1da43d7db943e568c \
    get_balance \
    --rpc=http://127.0.0.1:5050
----

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
[
    "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
]
----

The `invoke` command is used for write functions that modify their contract's storage, and submits a transaction to the network that changes its state. For example, you can invoke ``HelloStarknet``'s `increase_balance` function by running:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli invoke \
    0x02ceb6da76e2b2b80f2a23ff2910edf1dcc12e1b9d6a27d1da43d7db943e568c \
    increase_balance 42 \
    --rpc=http://127.0.0.1:5050
----

and entering your password. If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
Invoke transaction: 0x05be8823fc9b0c8605374d54f23f38badbd1b8ab4cbb680512cfde3f5662947b
----

You can verify that the state of your local Starknet instance has indeed changed by calling `get_balance` again:

[source,terminal]
----
starkli call \
    0x02ceb6da76e2b2b80f2a23ff2910edf1dcc12e1b9d6a27d1da43d7db943e568c \
    get_balance \
    --rpc=http://127.0.0.1:5050
----

If all goes well, the result should resemble the following (`42~10~ = 2a~16~`):

[source,console]
----
[
    "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a"
]
