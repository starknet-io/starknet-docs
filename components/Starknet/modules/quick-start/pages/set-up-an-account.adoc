= Setting up an account on Starknet Sepolia

== Introduction

Welcome to the second installment of the "Hello, Starknet!" quickstart series, the official tutorial for starting your journey as a Starknet developer! ðŸš€

To interact with Starknet, you first need an account to sign transactions. This installment of the series will therefore walk you through the steps necessary to create and deploy a new account on Starknet Sepolia.

[TIP]

== Creating a signer

Creating a Starkli account requires first creating a Starkli signer, which Starkli uses to sign transactions.
In this tutorial, we will use an encrypted keystores signer.
Encrypted keystores are JSON files that follow the https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/web3-secret-storage/[Web3 secret storage definition^].
Specifically, a password must be supplied to create a keystore and is required for when using it.
The main advantage of this approach is that it prevents storing the private key as plain text on your computer.

To create a new encrypted keystore signer, run:

[source,console]
----
$ starkli signer keystore new keystore.json
----

and enter a password that will be used to encrypt your private key. The result should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
Created new encrypted keystore file: ~/.starkli-accounts/my-first-account/keystore.json
Public key: 0x03dfdb739fbd3ddab0f851bf1131079e31ca266c7af94f05cef4d9481f837509
----

To avoid specifying the keystore file in every subsequent Starkli command, export the keystore path by running:

[source,console]
----
$ export STARKNET_KEYSTORE=$(pwd)/keystore.json
----

== Creating an account

Now that you have a Starkli signer, you can create a new account by running:

[source,console]
----
$ starkli account oz init account.json
----

[NOTE]
====
`oz` stand for OpenZeppelin, which, along with Argent and Braavos, are the accounts variants supported by Starkli.
====

The result should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
Created new account config file: ~/.starkli-accounts/my-first-account/account.json

Once deployed, this account will be available at:
    0x01cf4d57ba01109f018dec3ea079a38fc08b789e03de4df937ddb9e8a0ff853a

Deploy this account by running:
    starkli account deploy account.json
----

Similar to the exporting keystore path, export the account path to prevent specifying it in every subsequent Starkli command by running:

[source,console]
----
$ export STARKNET_ACCOUNT=$(pwd)/account.json
----

== Deploying an account

Finally, to deploy your account run:

[source,console]
----
$ starkli account deploy account.json --network=sepolia
----

This command sends a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction, which requires the account to contain enough ETH to pay for the transaction fee. 
When run, the command shows instructions on how to fund the account before proceeding.
You can fund your wallet using one of the https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/[Starknet Sepolia faucet^].

[NOTE]
====
To send the `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction with STRK as fee token, use:
[source,terminal]
----
starkli account deploy account.json --network=sepolia --strk
----
====

If the account was deployed successfully, the `deploy` command's output should resemble the following:

[source,console]
----
The estimated account deployment fee is 0.000011483579723913 ETH. However, to avoid failure, fund at least:
    0.000017225369585869 ETH
to the following address:
    0x01cf4d57ba01109f018dec3ea079a38fc08b789e03de4df937ddb9e8a0ff853a
Press [ENTER] once you've funded the address.
Waiting for transaction 0x06a9a08208084ac376f10657c745a3020362fa65e7730b13e08ec03d0cd7e59d to confirm.
If this process is interrupted, you will need to run `starkli account fetch` to update the account file.
Transaction not confirmed yet...
Transaction 0x06a9a08208084ac376f10657c745a3020362fa65e7730b13e08ec03d0cd7e59d confirmed
----

and you should be able to see the deployed account on one of xref:tools:ref-block-explorers.adoc[Starknet Sepolia's block explorers] by searching for its address.
