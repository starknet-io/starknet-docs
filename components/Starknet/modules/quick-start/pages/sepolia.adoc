= Deploying and interacting with the `HelloStarknet` contract on Starknet Sepolia

include::partial$snippet-important-troubleshooting.adoc[]

== Introduction

Welcome to the fourth installment of the "Hello, Starknet!" quickstart series, the official tutorial for starting your journey as a Starknet developer! ðŸš€

Starknet Sepolia is Starknet's testnet environment designed to provide developers with a testing ground that mirrors the behavior of the Starknet Mainnet while being connected to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, making it ideal for debugging and optimizing your code before deploying it to production. This installment of the series will therefore guide you through the steps necessary to deploy and interact with the `HelloStarknet` contract on Starknet Sepolia.

== Deploying a new Sepolia account

Similar to interacting with a Starknet Devnet instance, to interact with Starknet Sepolia you first need an account. However, instead fetching a predeployed Sepolia account, we will create a _new_ account and deploy it using `sncast` ourselves.

[NOTE]
====
To learn how to fetch a predeployed Sepolia account, check out xref:troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting].
====

To create the account's information (private key, address, etc.), navigate into the `hello_starknet` directory created in xref:hellostarknet.adoc#generating_hellostarknet[Generating `HelloStarknet`] and run:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast account create \
    --network=sepolia \
    --name=sepolia
----

When run, the command shows instructions on how to prefund the account before proceeding, which can be achieved using the https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/[Starknet Sepolia faucet^].

[NOTE]
====
Prefunding the account is required because deploying an account involves sending a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction, which requires the account to contain enough STRK to pay for the transaction fee.
====

Once your account is funded, you can deploy it by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast account deploy \
    --network sepolia \
    --name sepolia
----

If successful, the output of should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: account deploy
transaction_hash: 0x01340c0328b037bab85d53dd1b3b8040b0e0f4be58a42a94f554c9bf6e5bf30d

== Deploying `HelloStarknet` on Sepolia

Unlike when using a Starknet Devnet instance, there's no need for us to declare `HelloStarknet` on Sepolia as it has already been declared before (remember: declaration is a one-time process for each unique contract code). To verify that, you can try declaring it by navigating into the `hello_starknet` directory created in xref:hellostarknet.adoc#generating_hellostarknet[Generating `HelloStarknet`], running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --account=sepolia declare \
    --contract-name=HelloStarknet \
    --network=sepolia
----

The result should resemble to the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: declare
error: Transaction execution error = TransactionExecutionErrorData { transaction_index: 0, execution_error: Message("Class with hash 0x044701b93b7d2c072d37ebed1f2955f77472146fb0fbac158bd860426f72a9d6 is already declared.") }
----

With `HelloStarknet` already declared, you can deploy an instance of it by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --account=sepolia deploy \
    --class-hash=0x044701b93b7d2c072d37ebed1f2955f77472146fb0fbac158bd860426f72a9d6 \
    --network=sepolia
----

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: deploy
contract_address: 0x05fe561f0907f61b1099ba64ee18a5250606d43d00d4f296ba622d287ceb2538
transaction_hash: 0x0723a63261d2df60f571df8a2b8c8c64694278aae66481a0584445c03234d83f

To see deployment details, visit:
contract: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/contract/0x05fe561f0907f61b1099ba64ee18a5250606d43d00d4f296ba622d287ceb2538
transaction: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/0x0723a63261d2df60f571df8a2b8c8c64694278aae66481a0584445c03234d83f

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your deployed contract's address will be different the than one listed above. Make sure to use the address of your own deployed contract in the following section. 
====

== Interacting with `HelloStarknet` on Sepolia

Once your instance of `HelloStarknet` is deployed, you can invoke its `increase_balance` function by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast --account=sepolia invoke \
    --contract-address=0x05fe561f0907f61b1099ba64ee18a5250606d43d00d4f296ba622d287ceb2538 \
    --function=increase_balance \
    --arguments=66 \
    --network=sepolia
----

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
----
command: invoke
transaction_hash: 0x02b900ba6bfb6a7d256d34c5d3a895abbfa0805d23f80253958e101069700020

To see invocation details, visit:
transaction: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/0x02b900ba6bfb6a7d256d34c5d3a895abbfa0805d23f80253958e101069700020
----

Once the invoke transaction is accepted on Starknet Sepolia, you can call your deployed contract's `get_balance` function to confirm that your deployed contract's storage â€” and by extension, the state of Starknet Sepolia â€” has indeed changed, by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sncast call \
    --contract-address=0x05fe561f0907f61b1099ba64ee18a5250606d43d00d4f296ba622d287ceb2538 \
    --function=get_balance \
    --network=sepolia
----

If all goes well, the result should resemble the following (`66~10~ = 42~16~`):

[source,console]
----
command: call
response: [0x42]
----
