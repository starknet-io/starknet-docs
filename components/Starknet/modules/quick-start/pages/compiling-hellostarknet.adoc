= Compiling the `HelloStarknet` contract

== Introduction

Welcome to the second installment of the "Hello, Starknet!" quickstart series, the official tutorial for starting your journey as a Starknet developer! ðŸš€

Before a contract can be deployed on Starknet, its compiled code needs to be submitted to the network (also known as _declaring_ it). This installment of the series will therefore walk you though compiling Scarb's default `HelloStarknet` contract, which will be used throughout the following installments.

== Generating `HelloStarknet`

Scarb's default `HelloStarknet` contract can be generated by simply running:

[source,terminal]
----
scarb new hello_starknet
----

and selecting to set up the `Starknet Foundry (default)` test runner.

For the purpose of this tutorial, you can ignore all files in the `hello_starknet` directory other than `hello_starknet/src/lib.cairo`, which holds the contract's code:

[#example-cairo-contract]
[source,cairo]
----
/// Interface representing `HelloContract`.
/// This interface allows modification and retrieval of the contract balance.
#[starknet::interface]
pub trait IHelloStarknet<TContractState> {
    /// Increase contract balance.
    fn increase_balance(ref self: TContractState, amount: felt252);
    /// Retrieve contract balance.
    fn get_balance(self: @TContractState) -> felt252;
}

/// Simple contract for managing balance.
#[starknet::contract]
mod HelloStarknet {
    use core::starknet::storage::{StoragePointerReadAccess, StoragePointerWriteAccess};

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        balance: felt252,
    }

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl HelloStarknetImpl of super::IHelloStarknet<ContractState> {
        fn increase_balance(ref self: ContractState, amount: felt252) {
            assert(amount != 0, 'Amount cannot be 0');
            self.balance.write(self.balance.read() + amount);
        }

        fn get_balance(self: @ContractState) -> felt252 {
            self.balance.read()
        }
    }
}
----

As its comments read, this is a simple contract with two basic functions:

* `get_balance`, which reads the contract's current balance from storage.
* `increase_balance`, which reads the contract's current balance from storage, increases it by `amount` and writes the new balance to storage.

== Compiling `HelloStarknet`

To compile the `HelloStarknet` contract, navigate into the newly created `hello_starknet` directory and run:

[source,terminal]
----
scarb build
----

[NOTE]
====
The first time a project is built, some components of Scarb are compiled locally with the Rust toolchain. This process may take a few minutes, but will not happen in subsequent builds.
====

The compiled contract should now be saved inside the `hello_starknet/target/dev/` directory as `hello_starknet_HelloStarknet.contract_class.json`.
