= Deploying and interacting with a Starknet smart contract with Remix

include::ROOT:partial$snippet-note-content-from-sn-book.adoc[]

To compile, deploy, and interact with our smart contract, use the Starknet Remix plugin. This tool enables you to start to develop for Starknet without the need for any local installations on your machine.

== Setting up your environment in Remix

. Go to the https://remix.ethereum.org/#activate=Starknet&lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9.js[Remix IDE website with the Starknet plugin activated].
// . If Remix requests access to your file system, accept the request.
. Click the *File Explorer* image:quick-start:remix_file_explorer.png[File Explorer,24,24] tab to review the details of the example project.
. Click the *Starknet* image:quick-start:remix-starknet-icon.png[Starknet, 24,24] tab, and click the *Settings*. Select the latest version of Cairo available in Remix.
. In the File explorer, open the `Scarb.toml` file to verify the version of your project. Ensure it matches the version specified originally, and correct any discrepancies, if necessary.

== Customizing your environment for the `Ownable` contract

[NOTE]
====
For this tutorial, a default example project is provided. Modify or remove certain files and directories as needed.
====

. Rename the root directory to `ownable`. In your `Scarb.toml`, under the `[package]` section, set the name to `ownable`.
. Under `src/`, delete the `balance.cairo` and `forty_two.cairo` files, if they exist.
. Open `lib.cairo` and delete all its contents.

== Exploring the `ownable` Starknet smart contract

Explore the xref:#example-cairo-contract[Example `Ownable` contract], crafted in Cairo for Starknet. It includes:

* An ownership system.
* A method to transfer ownership.
* A method to check the current owner.
* An event notification for ownership changes.

use starknet::ContractAddress; <1>

#[starknet::interface]
trait OwnableTrait<T> { <1>
    fn transfer_ownership(ref self: T, new_owner: ContractAddress); <2>
    fn get_owner(self: @T) -> ContractAddress; <2>
}

#[starknet::contract]

    use super::ContractAddress;
    use starknet::get_caller_address;

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]

    }

    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    struct OwnershipTransferred { <3>
        #[key]
        prev_owner: ContractAddress,
        #[key]

            self.owner.read()
        }
    }

    #[generate_trait]
    impl PrivateMethods of PrivateMethodsTrait {
        fn only_owner(self: @ContractState) { <6>
            let caller = get_caller_address();
            assert(caller == self.owner.read(), 'Caller is not the owner');
        }
    }
}

=== Contract component breakdown

[horizontal,labelwidth="25",role="stripes-odd"]
<1> Dependencies and Interface: +
`starknet::ContractAddress`: Represents a Starknet contract address.
`OwnableTrait`: Defines essential functions for transferring and retrieving ownership.

<2> External Functions: Contains functions for transferring ownership and fetching information about the current owner.

<3> Events: `OwnershipTransferred` indicates changes in ownership, providing details about the previous and new owners.

<4> Storage: Stores the contract's state, including the address of the current owner.

<5> Constructor: Sets up the contract by assigning an initial owner.


<6> Private Methods: `only_owner` validates if the caller is the current owner.

== Compiling the contract

To compile using Remix:

. Click the *File Explorer* image:quick-start:remix_file_explorer.png[File Explorer,24,24] tab, open the `lib.cairo` file and insert the code from xref:#example-cairo-contract[].
. Click the *Starknet* image:quick-start:remix-starknet-icon.png[Starknet, 24,24] tab, then click *Home*.
. Under *(1) Compile*, click *Compile lib.cairo*.
. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted. Select *Remember my choice* for a smoother compilation process in the future.

The compilation process creates an `artifacts` directory containing the compiled contract in two formats: a Sierra file, in JSON format, and a Casm file. For Starknet deployment, Remix uses the Sierra file.

== Deploying your contract on the development network (devnet)

Deploying a smart contract in Starknet requires two high-level steps:

. Declare the class of your contract, that is, send your contractâ€™s code to the network.
+
When you declare the contract class, you establish an initial owner by calling the class's `constructor` function.
. Deploy an instance of the contract class.

This tutorial uses a development network (devnet) to deploy your smart contract. A devnet is a Starknet instance that you run as a local node. A devnet enables much quicker development than is possible using testnet, as well as providing privacy prior to launching on testnet.

.Declaring the contract class

. Select the network by clicking the *Starknet* tab, and then clicking the *Remote Devnet* menu.
. Under *Devnet account selection*, open the menu to view a list of accounts specific to the designated devnet.
. Select a devnet account from the list and note its address for later use.
. Click the *Declare `lib.cairo`* button.
+
Remix's terminal provides various logs with important details such as:
+
--
* `transaction_hash`: This unique hash identifies the transaction and can be used to track its status.
* `class_hash`: Similar to an identifier, the class hash contains the definition of the smart contract.
--
+

}
---------------------- End Declaring contract: lib.cairo ----------------------

After Remix declares the contract class, the *Declare* button says *Declared lib.cairo*.

Now you're ready to deploy an instance of the contract class.

.Deploying a contract instance

. Paste the Devnet account address you used into the `init_owner` variable.
+
image:quick-start:init_owner_field.png[]
. Click *Deploy*.

After deployment, Remix's terminal displays various logs, including a transaction receipt, containing important details, such as:

* `transaction_hash`: This unique hash identifies the transaction and can be used to track its status.
* `contract_address`: The address of the deployed contract. You can use this address to interact with your contract.
* `data`: Contains the `init_owner` address provided to the constructor.

         ...
      ]
    ...
}
---------------------- End Deploying contract: lib.cairo ----------------------

== Interacting with the contract

Now that the contract is operational on the development network, you can start interacting with it on the *Starknet* tab, under
 *(3) Interact*.

=== Identifying the owner of the contract instance

* Under *Read* you should see the `get_owner()` function. Click the *Call* button. The function doesn't require any arguments so the calldata field remains empty. This function reads data, so its invocation is referred to as a _call_.

The terminal displays the output, showing the owner's address, which you provided during the contract's deployment within the calldata for the constructor:

[source,json]
----
------------------- Calling get_owner ------------------------
{
  "resp": {
    "result": [
      "0x6b0ee6f418e47408cf56c6f98261c1c5693276943be12db9597b933d363df"
    ]
  },
  "contract": "lib.cairo",
  "function": "get_owner"
}
------------------- End calling get_owner --------------------
----

This call doesn't consume gas because the function doesn't modify the contract's state.

=== Transferring ownership of the contract instance

. Under *(3) Interact*, select *Write*, where functions that alter the contract's state are listed.
. Select the `transfer_ownership()` function, which requires providing the new owner address as input.
. Fill in the `new_owner` field with any Devnet address other than the one you used to deploy the contract.
+
[TIP]
====
Under *Devnet account selection*, open the menu, select a Devnet account from the list, and copy its address.
====
. Click the *Call* button. The terminal displays the transaction hash indicating the change in the contract's state. Because this interaction is an `INVOKE` transaction, and it modifies the contract's state. An `INVOKE` transaction requires the signature of the account executing the function.
+
For `INVOKE` transactions, the terminal logs include a `finality_status` parameter indicating the outcome. A status of `ACCEPTED_ON_L2` indicates approval by the Sequencer, the entity responsible for receiving and processing transactions, indicating inclusion in an upcoming block. Conversely, a `REJECTED` status indicates that the Sequencer did not approve the transaction, preventing its inclusion in the next block. Typically, transactions of this nature are approved, resulting in a modification of the contract's state.

== Deployment on Starknet testnet

After testing your smart contract on a development network, the next step is deploying it onto the Starknet testnet. The Starknet testnet is a public platform accessible to all, providing an excellent environment for testing smart contracts and encouraging collaboration among developers.

=== Setting up a smart wallet and a Starknet account on testnet

Before deploying your smart contract on Starknet, it's crucial to address transaction costs. While deploying on the Starknet testnet is free, having an operational smart wallet account is essential. You can set up a smart wallet and a Starknet account using either of the following platforms:

* https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/[Argent]
* https://braavos.app/[Braavos]

Both options offer robust Starknet wallets with advanced security measures and enhanced accessibility features enabled by the capabilities of the Cairo VM.

.Here's how to set up your smart wallet:

. Install the recommended browser extension corresponding to your chosen wallet.
. Follow the instructions provided by your wallet provider to deploy your account on testnet.
. Use the https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/[Starknet Faucet] to fund your account.
. Execute the deployment of your account onto the network, typically completed within approximately 10 seconds.

Once the setup is complete, you are primed to deploy your smart contracts onto the Starknet testnet.

=== Deployment and Interaction

. Proceed as per the aforementioned deployment steps.
. Within the *Environment selection* tab, Select *Wallet*.
. Select your Starknet account and proceed with the deployment and interaction processes for your contract.

You can monitor transaction hashes and addresses by using various Starknet block explorers such as:

* https://testnet.starkscan.co/[Starkscan]
* https://sepolia.voyager.online/[Voyager]
* https://viewblock.io/starknet[ViewBlock]
* https://www.oklink.com/starknet[Oklink]

These block explorers offer a graphical depiction of transactions and modifications to the contract state. Noteworthy is the visibility provided when altering contract ownership through the `transfer_ownership()` function, as the emitted event by the contract becomes observable within the block explorer. This mechanism serves as a potent means to monitor contractual events.
