= Setting up the environment

== Overview

Setting up your local development environment to develop for Starknet involves the following steps:

1. xref:#installing_the_prerequisites[Installing the prerequisites].
2. xref:#installing_the_additional_dependencies[Installing the additional dependencies].
3. xref:#installing_the_cairo_cli[Installing the Cairo CLI].
4. xref:#installing_the_cairo_compiler[Installing the Cairo compiler].


== Installing the prerequisites

Using a link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[Python virtual environment] is a good way to isolate your testing environment.

To create and enter the Python virtual environment, do one of the following:

* xref:#_manually_activating_the_cairo_virtual_environment[Activate your Cairo virtual
environment manually].
* xref:#_using_the_python_environment_manager_to_activate_the_cairo_virtual_environment[Use the Python environment manager].


=== Manually activating the Cairo virtual environment

Run the following two commands to manually create and activate a Cairo virtual environment:

[,Bash]
----
$ python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
$ source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
----

After creating and activating the virtual environment, you should see `(cairo_venv)` in the command line prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active, for example:

[,Bash]
----
(cairo_venv)
----


=== Using the Python environment manager to activate the Cairo virtual environment

Alternatively, you can use the Python environment manager to create a virtual environment:

[source,Bash]
----
$ curl https://pyenv.run | bash
----

Now add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

[source,Bash]
----
$ export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
$ eval "$(pyenv init -)"
$ eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
----

Restart your terminal and run the following commands:

[source,Bash]
----
$ pyenv install 3.9.0
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 cairo_venv
$ pyenv activate cairo_venv
----

you should see `(cairo_venv)` in the command line prompt, indicating that the virtual environment
is active, for example:

[source,Bash]
----
(cairo_venv)
----

== Installing the additional dependencies

Depending on your operating system, you may need to install the following, additional dependencies:
|===
|Dependency |Description

|`libgmp3-dev`/`gmp`|A software development library package for the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic
Library.
|`ECDSA` |(Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a digital signature algorithm that is based on the mathematics of elliptic curves.
|`FastECDSA`|An open-source software library that provides an implementation of the Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for use in cryptographic applications. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use, and is written in the Python programming language.
|`SymPy` |A Python library for symbolic mathematics.
|===


=== Linux
On Ubuntu, you will need to run the following command to install the `libgmp3-dev` library:

[source,Bash]
----
$ sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
----

=== macOS
On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install the `gmp` library:

[source,Bash]
----
$ brew install gmp
----

After that, you need to install the `ecdsa`, `fastecdsa` and `sympy` dependencies (Linux and Mac):

[source,Bash]
----
$ pip install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
----

=== Installing the Cairo CLI

You can interact with Starknet using the Cairo command line interface. If you had
a previous version of Cairo is installed, uninstall it and install the latest version:

=== Uninstalling the previous version (optional)
[source,Bash]
----
$ pip uninstall cairo-lang
----

=== Installing the latest version of Cairo

You can use `pip` to install the latest version of Cairo:

[source,Bash]
----
$ pip install cairo-lang
----

Alternatively, you can download a specific version of Cairo using this command:

[source,Bash]
----
$ pip install $HOME/Downloads/cairo-lang-0.12.0.zip
----

Once you have installed the Cairo package, make sure to test your installation by running the
following command:

[source,Bash]
----
$ starknet --version
----

You should see an output in your terminal similar to the below:
[source,Bash]
----
$ starknet 0.12.0
----

Make sure the version output matches the link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases[latest release].

== Installing the Cairo compiler

The Cairo compiler allows you to compile Cairo code into Cairo VM executable byte code.

To install the Cairo compiler, run the following commands:

=== Cloning the repository and setting up the Cairo compiler

Go to your $HOME directory

[source,Bash]
----
$ cd ~/
----

Clone the cairo Cairo 1 compiler to a folder called .cairo in your home directory

[source,Bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/ .cairo
$ cd .cairo/
$ git checkout tags/v1.0.0-alpha.6
$ cargo build --all --release
----

=== Adding the Cairo executables to your path

After building the Cairo binaries, add them to the PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

[source,Bash]
----
$ export PATH="$HOME/.cairo/target/release:$PATH"
----

Then, open a new shell and check that the following command returns a version number:

[source,Bash]
----
$ cairo-compile --version
----

Your output should look similar to the below:

[source,Bash]
----
$ cairo-lang-compiler 1.0.0-alpha.6
----

You are now able to compile, deploy and interact with smart contracts on Starknet
