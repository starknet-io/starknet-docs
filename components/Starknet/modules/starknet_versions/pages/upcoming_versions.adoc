# Upcoming Starknet versions

## Starknet Alpha v0.12.1

### What to expect
The focus of Starknet v0.12.1 is on improving the efficiency of the sequencer capacity. The proposed changes aim to address the issue of processing failed transactions and optimize the network's potential for valid transactions.

### Notable changes

Here are some notable changes to expect:

#### Mempool Validation:
A validation stage will be added to the mempool to prevent invalid transactions from consuming valuable sequencer time. Only valid transactions will proceed further in the processing pipeline.

#### Inclusion of Failed Transactions:
Failed transactions during the execution stage will be included in the block with the status "REVERTED" and the user will be charged for the consumed resources. This inclusion ensures transparency and allows developers to analyze the reasons for
transaction failures.

These enhancements will significantly improve the efficiency of the sequencer capacity and optimize the processing potential of Starknet for valid transactions.
