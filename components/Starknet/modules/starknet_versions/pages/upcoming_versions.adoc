[IMPORTANT]

While v3 transactions will support the following features, not all the features that they will support will be available in Starknet v0.13.0.
====

* A *fee market*, starting with Starknet v0.14.0, to enable users to optimize their transaction process by the network during periods of congestion.
* A *paymaster* mechanism, to enable entities other than the transaction sender to pay transaction fees.
* Account deployment will take place with an accountâ€™s initial Invoke or Declare transaction.
* *Volition mode*, for reducing data availability costs.
* *Nonce generalization*, enabling users to send multiple transactions simultaneously by specifying different channels for different transactions.
