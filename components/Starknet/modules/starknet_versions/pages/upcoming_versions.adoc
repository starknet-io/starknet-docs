# Upcoming Starknet versions

## Starknet Alpha v0.12.2

[id="what_to_expect"]
### What to expect
The focus of Starknet v0.12.2 is to enhance Starknet's reliability and performance.

### Notable changes

#### Enabling P2P Authentication
To establish a secure peer-to-peer network, Starknet is adding an endpoint in the sequencer gateway to provide a signature on the state diff commitment and block hash. This allows nodes to check the integrity of peerâ€™s data and avoid DoS attacks.

#### Resolving Mismatches in Queries
Starknet is introducing an extension to the `get_state_update` endpoint in the sequencer gateway that returns both the pending state diff and the pending block together. This simplifies the process for full nodes to address discrepancies between pending block and state diff queries.
