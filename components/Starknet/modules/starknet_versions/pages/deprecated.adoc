| Goerli testnet
a| Goerli testnet support was removed April 2, 2024. Sepolia testnet replaces Goerli testnet.

Starknet started migrating to Sepolia testnet on November 15th, 2023.  For more information on the Goerli deprecation, see https://ethereum.org/nb/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets[the deprecation announcement on Ethereum's site].

Full nodes, API services, SDKs, and other Starknet developer tools have migrated to Sepolia as well.

[NOTE]
====
Sepolia's state and history are relatively small. Sepolia xref:version_notes.adoc[supports declaring classes of CairoZero and Cairo v2.0.0 and higher].

| Starknet feeder gateway a| The Starknet feeder gateway, a temporary solution for querying the sequencerâ€™s state, is being replaced by Starknet full nodes (Pathfinder, Juno, Deoxys, Papyrus) and RPC services. For more information, see xref:tools:api-services.adoc[Full nodes and API services].

Support for the feeder gateway queries that are not required for full nodes to synchronize on the state of Starknet will stop according to the following schedule:
