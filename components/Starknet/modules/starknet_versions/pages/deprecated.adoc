| Goerli testnet
a| Goerli testnet is deprecated and is being replaced by Sepolia testnet. Starknet started migrating to Sepolia testnet on November 15th, 2023. Goerli testnet will be supported until the end of 2023. For more information on the Goerli deprecation, see https://ethereum.org/nb/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets[the deprecation announcement on Ethereum's site].

Full nodes, API services, SDKs, and other Starknet developer tools have started their migration to Sepolia as well. Builders are urged to migrate to Sepolia as soon as possible.

[NOTE]
====
Sepolia's state and history are relatively small. Sepolia xref:version_notes.adoc[supports declaring classes of Cairo v0 and Cairo v2.0.0 and higher].
====

|Starknet CLI | The Starknet CLI is deprecated. Instead use xref:cli:starkli.adoc[Starkli].
