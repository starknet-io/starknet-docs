For a comprehensive list of tokens that StarkGate supports, including their L1 and L2 addresses, see the JSON files shown in the following table:

[NOTE]
====
StarkGate enforces xref:architecture-and-concepts:network-architecture/messaging-mechanism.adoc#l1-l2-message-fees[fees] for all procedures to account for L1->L2 message costs.

Fees for depositing funds or enrolling a token bridge on StarkGate, can be estimated using the `estimateDepositFeeWei` or `estimateEnrollmentFeeWei` function.
