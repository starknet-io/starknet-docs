= Adding a token to StarkGate

StarkGate supports permissionless bridging.

To permissionlessly add support for an ERC-20 token, use the `enrollTokenBridge` function. You can access this function using a block explorer or a CLI.

include::partial$snippet_enrollTokenBridge_note.adoc[]

When you enroll a new ERC-20 token, StarkGate does the following:

. Adds bridge functionality for that token on L1 using the `StarknetTokenBridge.sol` contract.
. Adds bridge functionality for that token on L2 using the `token_bridge.cairo` class.
. Creates a new ERC-20 token contract on L2 based on a standard ERC-20 contract class. Each new contract uses the class hash of this contract class to identify its inheritance.
+
[NOTE]
====
When the code of `token_bridge.cairo` is updated, its class hash changes. However,any existing contract continues to refer to the previous class hash. Any new contracts use the new class hash.
====

Be aware of the following:

* The L2 ERC-20 contract is a standard contract, so it is not recommended to add tokens with non-standard behavior, such as inflationary tokens.

* Adding a token that requires a customized bridging mechanism or a non-standard ERC-20 contract on L2 is currently not permissionless, and can be done only by the StarkWare team. Please contact StarkWare at support@starknetcommunity.io.
