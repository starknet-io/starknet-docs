= Depositing funds with StarkGate

:description: How to deposit funds in StarkGate using a function in a block explorer, and what happens when you deposit funds into StarkGate.

Using StarkGate to deposit L1 funds into the L2 Starknet requires StarkGate's `deposit` function. The `deposit` function does the following:

. Transfers the funds from the user's Ethereum account to the StarkGate L1 contract.
. Emits a `Deposit` event that includes the L1 and L2 addresses of the user, and the amount deposited.
. Sends a message to the corresponding L2 bridge with the amount deposited, and the recipient's address.

Subsequently, the funds should be transferred to Starknet so that you can begin using them.

For more information on what happens during the transfer process, see xref:overview.adoc#l1l2_transfer_deposit[L1->L2 transfer (deposit)].

.Prerequisites

* An Ethereum block explorer, such as link:https://etherscan.io[Etherscan].
* Funds to transfer from L1 to L2, including enough to pay the fees required for the transfer.
* The L1 address of the StarkGate bridge for the token you want to deposit. To view the token addresses for tokens on Mainnet or Sepolia testnet, see xref:tools:bridged-tokens.adoc[].

.Procedure

. Using an Ethereum block explorer, go to the StarkGate contract and click *Write as Proxy*. For example, using Etherscan, go to link:https://etherscan.io/address/0xae0ee0a63a2ce6baeeffe56e7714fb4efe48d419#writeProxyContract[0xae0ee0a63a2ce6baeeffe56e7714fb4efe48d419]
. Click the StarkGate 2.0 `deposit` function (0x0efe6a8b).
. Enter the following:
+
* In *`payableAmount`*, enter the maximum amount of ETH that you're willing to pay for the `deposit` transaction fee.
* In *`token (address)`*, enter the address of the L1 contract for the token that you want to deposit to L2.
* In *`amount (uint256)`*, enter an integer for the amount of the token that you want to deposit to L2.
* In *`l2Recipient (uint256)`*, enter the address of the recipient on L2.
. Click *Write*. The `deposit` function initiates a deposit.
