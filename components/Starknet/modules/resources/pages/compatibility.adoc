= Starknet Compatibility Tables

== Overview

The Starknet development ecosystem consists of tools built to work and support the latest version of Starknet. As Starknet evolves, these tools are updated to support its latest features.

Each version of Starknet is usually coupled with an update of all or some of:

* Starknet API
* Cairo
* Sierra

The following tables provide an overview of the compatibility between Starknet updates and the tools in the ecosystem.
