== Current limits

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following limits are subject to revisions and change on a regular basis
====

[NOTE]
====
Starting from v0.13.0, blockifier-related constants and limits are defined for each Starknet version in a JSON file called `versioned_constants` in the https://github.com/starkware-libs/sequencer/tree/main/crates/blockifier/resources[blockifier's resources directory^].

Starting from v0.13.5, resources are denominated in units of L2 gas, L1 gas, and L1 data gas.

== Deprecated features

[NOTE]
====
A deprecated feature is a feature that is still supported, but support will be removed in a future release of Starknet.
====

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description

| Cairo 0
| xref:resources:version-notes.adoc#version0.11.0[Starknet v0.11.0] introduces Cairo 1.0 smart contracts.

| Transaction signing only over two resources
| RPC version 0.8, introduced in Starknet 0.13.5, only supports `v3` transactions that sign over three resources (L1 gas, L2 gas and L1 data gas), removing support for transaction versions `v0`, `v1`, and `v2`, and for `v3` transactions that sign only over two resources (L1 gas and L2 gas).

Starting from version v0.14.0, Starknet will stop accepting these transactions altogether, and will only accept `v3` transactions compliant with RPC 0.8.
|===

== Unsupported and removed features

[NOTE]
====
An unsupported feature is a feature that is no longer supported.

A removed feature is a feature that has been entirely removed.
====

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name | Description

| Starknet CLI
| Support for the Starknet CLI has been removed. Instead use xref:tools:interacting-with-starknet.adoc[Starkli or Starknet Foundry's `sncast`].

| Goerli testnet
a| Goerli testnet support was removed April 2, 2024. Sepolia testnet replaces Goerli testnet.

Starknet started migrating to Sepolia testnet on November 15th, 2023.  For more information on the Goerli deprecation, see https://ethereum.org/nb/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets[the deprecation announcement on Ethereum's site].

Full nodes, API services, SDKs, and other Starknet developer tools have migrated to Sepolia as well.

[NOTE]
====
Sepolia's state and history are relatively small. Sepolia xref:resources:version-notes.adoc[supports declaring classes of CairoZero and Cairo v2.0.0 and higher].
====

| Starknet feeder gateway
a| The Starknet feeder gateway, a temporary solution for querying the sequencer's state, is being replaced by Starknet full nodes (Pathfinder, Juno, Deoxys, Papyrus) and RPC services. For more information, see xref:ecosystem:fullnodes-rpc-providers.adoc[Full nodes and API services].

Support for the feeder gateway queries that are not required for full nodes to synchronize on the state of Starknet will stop according to the following schedule:

!===
!Environment !Date

!Integration
!1 November 2023
!Testnet
!15 November 2023
!Mainnet

Queries that are required for full nodes to synchronize on the state of Starknet are still supported.

For more information, see the Community Forum post https://community.starknet.io/t/feeder-gateway-deprecation/100233[_Feeder Gateway Deprecation_^].

| Free L1-> L2 messaging
| Previously, sending a message from L1 to L2 had an optional fee associated.

From xref:resources:version-notes.adoc#version0.11.0[Starknet v0.11.0], the fee mechanism is enforced and the ability to send L1->L2 messages without the corresponding L2 fee has been removed.

See xref:architecture-and-concepts:messaging.adoc#l1-l2-message-fees[here] for more details.

| `invoke` transaction v0
| `invoke` transaction v0 has been removed since xref:resources:version-notes.adoc#version0.11.0[Starknet v0.11.0].
| `declare` transaction v0 |`declare` transaction v0 has been removed since xref:resources:version-notes.adoc#version0.11.0[Starknet v0.11.0].

| `deploy` transaction
| The `deploy` transaction has been removed since xref:resources:version-notes.adoc#version0.10.3[Starknet v0.10.3].

To deploy new contract instances, you can use the https://book.cairo-lang.org/appendix-08-system-calls.html#deploy[`deploy` system call].
