= Exiting the Staking Protocol

:description: How to exit the staking protocol on Starknet by unstaking as a validator or undelegating as a delegator through direct interaction with the staking or delegation pooling contracts.

Exiting the staking protocol involves either unstaking your STRK tokens as a validator or undelegating your stake as a delegator. Both processes require you to first signal your intent to exit, followed by an action to finalize the process after a waiting period.

== Unstaking as a Validator

Validators can unstake their STRK tokens, which involves pausing rewards and exiting the staking contract.

.Prerequisites

* The validator must not currently be in the unstake process.

.Procedure

1. **Signal Unstake Intent:**
. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the staking contract.
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `unstake_intent` function.
. Submit the transaction to initiate the unstake process. This will record the unstake intent, pause rewards collection, and set a waiting period.

2. **Finalize Unstake:**
. After the waiting period has passed, return to the staking contract.
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `unstake_action` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`staker_address`*, enter the validator's address.
. Submit the transaction to finalize the unstaking process and transfer the staked STRK tokens back to the validator's account.

[NOTE]
====
Any address can initiate the `unstake_action` function once the waiting period has passed.
====

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that enough time has passed since signaling your unstake intent. If the waiting period has not expired, the `unstake_action` function will fail.
====

== Undelegating as a Delegator

Delegators can undelegate part or all of their stake from a validator's delegation pool by following a similar process. The `amount` parameter determines how much of the stake will be undelegated, and it must be less than or equal to the total delegated amount.

.Prerequisites

* A Starknet-compatible block explorer or CLI tool.
* The delegator must not currently be in the undelegation process.
* The contract address of the delegation pooling contract.

.Procedure

1. **Signal Undelegation Intent:**
. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the delegation pooling contract.
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `exit_delegation_pool_intent` function.
. Enter the `amount` parameter, which determines the size of the undelegation. The amount must be less than or equal to your total delegated amount.
. Submit the transaction to initiate the undelegation process. This will record the undelegation intent for the specified amount, pause rewards collection, and set a waiting period.

2. **Finalize Undelegation:**
. After the waiting period has passed, return to the delegation pooling contract.
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `exit_delegation_pool_action` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`pool_member`*, enter the delegator's address.
. Submit the transaction to finalize the undelegation process and transfer the undelegated STRK tokens (based on the amount previously specified) back to the delegator's account.

[NOTE]
====
Any address can initiate the `exit_delegation_pool_action` function once the waiting period has passed.
====

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that enough time has passed since signaling your undelegation intent. If the waiting period has not expired, the `exit_delegation_pool_action` function will fail. Additionally, ensure the `amount` provided in the initial intent matches the intended undelegation size.

== Additional Notes

- When a validator unstakes, any unclaimed rewards are automatically transferred to the reward address before the stake is returned.
- Similarly, when a delegator undelegates, any unclaimed rewards are automatically transferred to the delegator’s reward address.
