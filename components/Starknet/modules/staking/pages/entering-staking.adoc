:description: How to enter the staking protocol on Starknet by interacting directly with the staking contract.

Using the Starknet staking contract to stake STRK tokens requires interacting with the `stake` function. The `stake` function does the following:

. Locks the specified amount of STRK tokens from the validator’s account into the staking contract.
. Records the validator's details, including reward and operational addresses, in the staking contract.
. If pooling is enabled, deploys a new delegation pool contract associated with the validator.

Subsequently, the validator’s tokens will be locked in the staking contract, and the validator will begin earning rewards based on their stake.

For more information on what happens during the staking process, see xref:architecture.adoc#staking-contract[Staking Architecture].

.Prerequisites

* Validators are required to run full nodes in preparation for the following stages of the protocol. You can use any full node implementation you choose:
** https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno[Juno] by Nethermind: https://juno.nethermind.io/hardware-requirements[juno.nethermind.io/hardware-requirements]
** https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder[Pathfinder] by Equilibrium: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-requirements[github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-requirements]
** https://github.com/madara-alliance/madara[Madara] by Madara Alliance: https://docs.madara.build/Installation/requirements[docs.madara.build/Installation/requirements]
* A Starknet-compatible xref:tools:ref-block-explorers.adoc[block explorer] or xref:tools:devtools/clis.adoc[CLI tool].
* Sufficient STRK token balance in your wallet.

[NOTE]
====
For validators who wish to use a secure hardware wallet, the https://www.ledger.com/[Ledger hardware wallet] is supported by both https://www.argent.xyz/blog/ledger-argent-integration/[Argent] and https://braavos.app/wallet-features/ledger-on-braavos/[Braavos] wallets.

.Procedure

. If you are using a block explorer:
.. Navigate to the STRK contract by searching for xref:tools:important-addresses.adoc#fee_tokens[its address]
.. In the contract interface, locate and select the `approve` function.
. Pre-approve the STRK ERC20 contract for the transfer of tokens from your address to the staking contract by invoking its `approve` function with the following parameters:
* In the first parameter (`spender`), enter the xref:overview.adoc#staking_contract[staking contract's address].
* In the second parameter (`amount`), enter the number of STRK tokens you want to stake (note the xref:overview.adoc#economic_parameters[minimum stake for validators] and that STRK has 18 decimals).

[TIP]
====
If you using Starkli as CLI tool, the following example, which approves the STRK contract to transfer 1 STRK to the staking contract on Sepolia, can be used as reference:

[start=3]
. If you are using a block explorer:
.. Navigate to the staking contract by searching for xref:overview.adoc#staking_contract[its address].
.. In the contract interface, locate and select the `stake` function.
. Invoke the staking contract's `stake` function with the following parameters:
* In the first parameter (`reward_address`), enter the address where the rewards will be sent.
* In the second parameter (`operational_address`), enter the address that xref:overview.adoc#first_stage[in the future] will be used for block attestations and sequencing.
* In the third parameter (`amount`), enter the number of STRK tokens you want to stake (note the xref:overview.adoc#economic_parameters[minimum stake for validators] and that STRK has 18 decimals).
* In the fourth parameter (`pool_enabled`), enter `1` (true) if you wish to enable delegation pooling, otherwise enter `0` (false).
* In the fifth parameter (`commission`), enter the commission rate for any delegated staking. The rate should be entered as a percentage with precision, where 10000 represents 100%. For example, to set a 5% commission, you would enter 500.

If you are using Starkli as CLI tool, the following example, which stakes 1 STRK with delegation pooling enabled and 1% commission on Sepolia, can be used as reference:
