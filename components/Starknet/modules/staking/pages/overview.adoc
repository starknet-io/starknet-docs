= Staking Overview

Staking on Starknet involves locking STRK tokens in the staking protocol, contributing to network security and performance. Anyone holding STRK in their wallets can stake their tokens on Starknet either directly or by delegating their tokens to others, with rewards based on their level of participation and contribution.
 
In this first phase, validators are required to stake a minimum of 20,000 STRK tokens and run a full node in preparation for future staking phases, which will entail further responsibilities and contributions to network maintenance and security.  

The key terms used in this document are:

* _Stake_: Locking STRK tokens into the staking protocol.
* _Delegate_: Assigning STRK tokens to a validator to participate indirectly.
* _Reward_: Earnings from participating in staking.

[NOTE]
====
STRK tokens never leave the Starknet protocol during these operations.

=== Overview

The staking protocol features two main options:

* _Staking_: Users can stake any amount of STRK, with a minimum threshold set at 20,000 STRK. Validators are expected to run full nodes and eventually handle additional responsibilities as the protocol evolves. Validators can choose whether to allow delegation.
* _Stake Delegation_: Users can delegate their STRK to validators without running their own nodes, if the validator allows delegation. Delegators share in the rewards earned by the validators they choose.

Validators and delegators can both unstake their funds, subject to network-defined latencies for security.

=== A first stage

In the future, as part of Starknet’s Consensus protocol, Validators will be responsible for maintaining and securing the network by producing, attesting, and proving blocks. However, it’s not feasible to hand over these responsibilities all in one day. Specifically, in this proposed first stage, we will test the protocol’s economic incentive structure and some of its key smart contract components *while Validators are required to run full nodes*. 

Over time, Validators’ responsibilities will gradually increase, with each phase bringing additional tasks until they fully maintain and secure the network.
This incremental approach is necessary, as it allows for the following:

* _Gradual Implementation_: A PoS protocol is a complex structure that requires comprehensive testing and validation. Introducing its features in small, manageable milestones ensures that each step is carefully implemented and easily integrated. This approach also allows us to refine the process and address issues as they arise.
* _Validator’s Preparation_: Giving Validators time to adapt to new responsibilities, ensuring they are ready for their critical roles, and maximizing network stability during the transition.
* _Proven Reliability_: By the time Validators perform the aforementioned roles, we aim to have a proven set of sequencers that reliably produce and attest blocks, ensuring the network’s stability and performance.

=== Minting Curve

The minting curve balances participation and inflation by adjusting rewards based on the total STRK locked in the protocol. It is defined by the formula:

[stem]
++++
M = \frac{C}{10} \times \sqrt{S}
++++

Where:

* stem:[S] is the staking rate as a percentage of the total token supply.
* stem:[M] is the annual minting rate as a percentage of the total token supply.
* stem:[C] is the maximum theoretical inflation percentage.

For the first stage, stem:[C] is proposed to be 1.6%.

=== Staking Rewards

Rewards are distributed based on the amount staked and the commission policy constant stem:[CP] set by the validator. The yearly reward percentages are calculated using the following formulas:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
\text{Validators: } & \; \left[\text{self_stake} + \text{total_stake_delegated} \times CP\right] \times \frac{M}{S} \\
\text{Stake Delegators: } & \; \text{stake_delegated} \times (1 - CP) \times \frac{M}{S}
\end{align}
++++

M and S are the same as described above in the minting curve section.

=== Latencies

* **Current Version**: Immediate entry and exit from the staking protocol. However, funds are subject to a 21-day security lockup after signaling unstake intent.
* **Future Versions**: Introduction of epochs to determine entry/exit latencies and continued 21-day lockup after signaling unstake intent.

[NOTE]
====
Stake delegators can switch between validators without waiting for the full lockup period, promoting a competitive delegation market.

=== Economic Parameters

The proposed economic parameters are:

* **Minimum STRK for Staking:** 20,000 STRK
* **Withdrawal Security Lockup:** 21 days
* **Minting Curve Yearly Inflation Cap (stem:[C]):** 1.6% (see link:https://community.starknet.io/t/staking-on-starknet-voting-proposal/114442/[here] for the relevant voting proposal)
* **Commission Policy Parameter (stem:[CP]):** Set by the validator (0 - 1). In this first version, it can only be lowered once set. In future versions, more elaborate commission policies would be enabled.

These values are our proposed starting points for this version of the protocol. As part of the rationale behind this version, they are subject to change and may be adjusted to better suit the protocol’s needs under the proper governance procedures.
