= Staking on Starknet guide overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is a hands-on guide for developers interacting with Starknet's staking protocol. To learn about the staking protocol, go to xref:architecture-and-concepts:staking.adoc[Architecture].
====

Staking on Starknet involves locking STRK tokens in the staking protocol, contributing to network security and performance. Anyone holding STRK in their wallets can stake their tokens on Starknet as either validators or delegatiors and earn rewards based on their level of participation and contribution.

This guide will walk you through the various procedures enabled by the staking protocol, including:

* xref:staking-as-validators.adoc[]: Attesting to blocks, initializing stake, increasing stake, claiming rewards, exiting the protocol, opening a delegation pool, updating the commission rate, and changing operational and rewards addresses
* xref:staking-as-delegators.adoc[]: Delegating stake, claiming rewards, undelegating stakes, switching delegation pools, and changing the rewards address
