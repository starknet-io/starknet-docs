:description: How to increase your stake on Starknet by interacting directly with the staking or delegation pooling contracts.

The staking and pooling contracts allow validators and delegators to increase their existing stake. Validators use the `increase_stake` function, which is called from the staking contract, while delegators use the `add_to_delegation_pool` function, which is called from the delegation pooling contract. These functions add the specified amount of STRK tokens to the current stake, recalculate rewards before the staked amount is updated, and update the total staked amount.

.Prerequisites

* Sufficient STRK token balance in your Starknet wallet.
* The validator/delegator must have pre-approved the relevant contract (staking contract for validators, delegation pooling contract for delegators) to transfer the specified STRK amount from their account.
* The validator/delegator must not be in an unstake/undelegate process.
* The caller must be either the validator/delegator or their respective reward address.

.Procedure

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the relevant contract (staking contract for validators, delegation pooling contract for delegators).
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `increase_stake` function (for validators) or the `add_to_delegation_pool` function (for delegators).
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`address`*, enter the address of the validator (for `increase_stake`) or the delegator (for `add_to_delegation_pool`) whose stake you want to increase. This can be either the validator's/delegator's address or their respective reward address.
* In *`amount`*, enter the number of STRK tokens you want to add to the existing stake.
. Submit the transaction to execute the stake increase.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the validator/delegator is not in an unstake/undelegate process before attempting to increase the stake. If they are currently unstaking/undelegating, this function will fail.
