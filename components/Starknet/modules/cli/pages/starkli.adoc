[id="legacy"]
= Legacy Starknet CLI reference

[WARNING]
====
The Starknet CLI is deprecated. Instead, use xref:tools:devtools.adoc#starkli[StarkLi CLI].
====

[id="basic_command_line_syntax"]
== Basic command line syntax

To enter a Starknet command, use the following syntax:

[source,bash]
----
$ starknet <command> <options>
----

Where:

`<command>` represents a single command that executes an operation on Starknet.

`<options>` represents zero or more command line options, each of which modifies the operation of the command.

[id="setting_the_starknet_network_environment"]
== Setting the Starknet network environment

You need to set your Starknet network environment to use either testnet or Mainnet.

You can set the environment using either a command-line option or an environment variable.

Possible values are:

`alpha-goerli`:: Sets the Starknet network to testnet
`alpha-mainnet`:: Sets the Starknet network to Mainnet

.Setting the network environment using a command-line option

When you enter any command, include the `--network` option. For example to use Mainnet, enter a command as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ starknet <command> --network alpha-mainnet <options>
----

[NOTE]
====
You can place the `--network` option before or after any other option.
====

.Setting the network environment using an environment variable

Set the `STARKNET_NETWORK` environment variable as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ export STARKNET_NETWORK=<starknet_network>
----

For example, to use testnet, enter the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
----

== Setting custom endpoints

When working with the CLI, you can manually set the endpoints for the gateways that enable you to
interact with Starknet, by including the following options:

`--feeder_gateway_url`:: Sets the custom endpoint for read commands.
`--gateway_url`:: Sets the custom endpoint for write commands.

The following are the endpoints for Starknet testnet and Mainnet:

* Testnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/
* Mainnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/
* Testnet gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/gateway/
* Mainnet gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/

.Example: Setting a custom read endpoint

The following command returns the ABI using the Mainnet feeder gateway.

[source,bash]
----
$ starknet get_code --feeder_gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ <options>
----

.Example: Setting a custom write endpoint

The following command sends a transaction to the Starknet sequencer
using the Mainnet gateway.

[source,bash]
----
$ starknet invoke --gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ <options>
----

[id="block_tag"]

[NOTE]
====
*Block Tag*

A block context can be specified via the `latest` or `pending` tags, where the former refers to the latest accepted on L2 block and the latter refers to the xref:architecture_and_concepts:Network_Architecture/transaction-life-cycle.adoc#the-pending-block[pending block].

[source,terminal]
----
starknet deploy

  --contract <contract_definition>
  --inputs <constructor_inputs>
  --token <token>
----

Deploys a new contract, accepts the following arguments:

- `salt` - a seed that is used in the computation of the contract’s address (if not specified, the sequencer will choose a random string)
- `contract_definition`* - path to a JSON file containing the contract’s bytecode and abi (can be obtained by executing link:https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/intro.html#compile-the-contract[starknet-compile])
- `constructor_inputs`* - the arguments given to the contract’s constructor, represented by a list of space-delimited values
- `token` - a token allowing contract deployment (can be obtained by applying link:https://forms.reform.app/starkware/SN-Alpha-Contract-Deployment/l894lu[here]). Only used in the Alpha stages and will be deprecated in the future

[NOTE]
====
The deploy token is a temporary measure which will be deprecated when fees are incorporated in the system. Only relevant for Mainnet.
====


[id="starknet_deploy_account"]
== `starknet deploy_account`

[source,terminal]
----
starknet deploy_account
  --wallet <wallet_provider>
  --account <account_name>
----

Deploys an account contract, accepts the following arguments:

- `account_name` - the name given to the account, used for managing multiple accounts from the CLI (if not specified, the name
`+__default__+` is used.
- `wallet_provider`* - the path to module which manages the account (responsible for key generation, signing, etc.)

[NOTE]
====

Today, the Starknet CLI only works with the link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/third_party/open_zeppelin/Account.cairo[OpenZeppelin account contract].
The CLI uses this specific link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/wallets/open_zeppelin.py[wallet provider].
To use this provider, either set up the following environment variable or pass the same value directly to the `wallet_provider` parameter:

[source,bash]
----
$ export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
----
====

[CAUTION]
====
Using the built-in wallet providers that are part of the cairo-lang package (starkware.starknet.wallets...) is _not secure_ (for example, the private key may be kept not encrypted and without backup in your home directory). You should only use them if you’re not overly concerned with losing access to your accounts (for example, for testing purposes).

[TIP]
====

Today, interaction with Starknet may be done either via account or by a direct call. The `signature` argument can only be provided in the case of a direct call, since otherwise providing the signature is the responsibility of the account module. To use an account you must specify `wallet_name`, otherwise a direct call will be used (you may also explicitly perform a direct call by adding `--no_wallet` to the command). Note that in the future direct calls will be deprecated and the only way to interact with the system would be through accounts.

The possible statuses of a transaction are:

* `NOT_RECEIVED`
