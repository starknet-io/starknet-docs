= Declaring a smart contract


== Prerequisites

=== Ensure Starkli and Scarb are installed correctly
Ensure that the below commands are working properly on your system.

[source, bash]
----
starkli --version
scarb --version
----

If either of the above commands fails, see xref:environment_setup.adoc[Setting up your environment].

== Introduction

Deploying a smart contract in Starknet requires two steps:

* Declaring the class of your contract, i.e. sending your contract's code to the network.
* Deploying a contract, i.e. creating an instance of the code you previously declared.

[TIP]
====
If you require an example smart contract to test with, you can use a pre prepared example from the Starknet Book link:https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook/blob/main/chapters/book/modules/chapter_1/pages/contracts/src/lib.cairo[here].
====

== Compiling a smart contract

You can compile a smart contract using the Scarb compiler.

To compile a smart contract, create a directory containing a `Scarb.toml` file and a subdirectory named `src` containing your contract source code.

Add the following code to the `Scarb.toml` file:

[source,toml]
----
[package]
name = "contracts"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.2.0"

[[target.starknet-contract]]
sierra = true
----

Navigate into the newly created directory:
[source,bash]
----
cd <dir_name>
----

Run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
scarb build
----

The compiled contract will be saved in the `target/dev/` directory.

The contract is now compiled and ready to be deployed. Next you will need to declare an RPC provider within your contract.

== Setting an RPC provider

To interact with the Starknet network, you need to set an RPC endpoint within Starkli.

The following are the RPC providers available for Starknet:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Provider name |Description

|Infura or Alchemy
|Use a provider like Infura or Alchemy.

|Custom configuration
|Set up your own node and use the RPC provider of your node. More information on this can be found within the link:https://book.starknet.io/chapter_4/node.html[Starknet Book].

|===

For demonstration purposes, the Starknet Sequencer's Gateway is used in the below steps.

== Declaring a smart contract

A contract can be declared on Starknet using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
starkli declare target/dev/<NAME>.json --network=goerli-1 --compiler-version=2.1.0
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--network` flag is used to specify the network you want to use, it could also be `mainnet` for example.

The `--compiler-version` flag is used to specify the version of the compiler you want to use. Starkli is currently running on version `2.1.0` and `2.0.1` of the compiler.
====


You can find the compiler version supported by Starkli by running:

[source,bash]
----
starkli declare --help 
----

In the `--compiler-version` flag you will see possible versions of the compiler:

[source,bash]
----
--compiler-version <COMPILER_VERSION>
          Statically-linked Sierra compiler version [possible values: 2.0.1, 2.1.0]
----

However, the Scarb compiler version may be `2.2.0`, you can find this out by running:

[source,bash]
----
scarb --version
----

This is because Starkli and Scarb are not always in sync.

In this case you would need to use the compiler version that Starkli is using by installing a previous version of Scarb. See the https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/releases[Scarb github repo] for more detail.

You can do this by running the following command for installing Scarb version `0.6.1`:

[source,bash]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 0.6.1
----

If you were using a provider like Infura or Alchemy, the declaration command would look like this:

[source,bash]
----
starkli declare target/dev/contracts_Ownable.sierra.json \
    --rpc=https://starknet-goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY> \ 
    --compiler-version=2.1.0
----

== Expected result

The result of the declaration command is a contract class hash:
[source,bash]
----
Class hash declared: <CLASS_HASH>
----

This hash is the identifier of the contract class in Starknet. You can think of it as the address of the contract class. You can use a block explorer like https://testnet.starkscan.co/class/0x00e68b4b07aeecc72f768b1c086d9b0aadce131a40a1067ffb92d0b480cf325d[StarkScan] to see the contract class hash in the blockchain.

If the contract you are declaring has previously been declared by someone else, you will get an output like this:

[source,bash]
----
Not declaring class as its already declared. Class hash: <CLASS_HASH>
----
