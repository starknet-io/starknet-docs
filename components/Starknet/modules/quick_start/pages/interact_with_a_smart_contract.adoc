= Interacting with a smart contract

== Prerequisites

=== Ensure Starkli and Scarb are installed correctly
Ensure that the below commands are working properly on your system.

[source, bash]
----
starkli --version
scarb --version
----

If either of the above commands fail, see xref:environment_setup.adoc[Setting up your environment].

== Introduction

Starkli enables interaction with smart contracts via two primary methods:

* `call` for read-only functions.
* `invoke` for write functions that modify the state.

== Calling a function

The `call` command allows querying a smart contract function without sending a transaction.

As an example you can use the `get_owner` function which doesn't expect any arguments and returns the address of the current owner:

[source,bash]
----
starkli call \
    0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \
    get_owner --network=goerli-1
----

This will return the address that we passed to the constructor during deployment:

[source,bash]
----
[
    "0x02cdab749380950e7a7c0deff5ea8edd716feb3a2952add4e5659655077b8510"
]
----

== Invoking a function

To modify the state of the smart contract, use the `invoke` command. Unlike the `call` command, `invoke` submits a transaction to the network.

In this example, we'll invoke the `transfer_ownership` function to transfer the ownership from our deployer address to a different smart wallet address:

[source,bash]
----
starkli invoke \
    0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \
    transfer_ownership \
    0x011088d3cbe4289bc6750ee3a9cf35e52f4fa4e0ac9f42fb0b62e983139e135a \
    --network=goerli-1
----

After the transaction is accepted on L2, you can confirm the state transition by calling the `get_owner` function again:

[source,bash]
----
starkli call \
    0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \
    get_owner \
    --network=goerli-1
----

The `get_owner` function now returns the new owner address, confirming the successful ownership transfer.
