= Setting up an account

[TIP]
====
This guide shows you how to set up a Starknet account and wallet in the context of a smart contract deployment.

For information on creating a Starknet wallet as an end user, see link:https://www.starknet.io/en/posts/stark-math/getting-started-using-starknet-setting-up-a-starknet-wallet[_Getting Started Using Starknet: Setting Up a Starknet Wallet_].
====

== Prerequisites

=== Ensure Starkli and Scarb are installed correctly

Ensure that the following commands show the version information for Starkli and Scarb:

[source, bash]
----
starkli --version
scarb --version
----

If either command fails, see xref:environment_setup.adoc[Setting up your environment].

=== Download, install and set up Argent X or Braavos wallet

Install a Starknet wallet via Argent X or Braavos. For information on a specific wallet, including installation instructions, see that wallet’s site.

== Creating an account
A smart wallet is composed of two parts:

* A Signer: A smart contract that can sign transactions.
* An Account Descriptor: A json file that contains information about the smart wallet, such as its address and
public key.

After creating and funding your smart wallet with ETH you can deploy it to Starknet. For demonstration purposes, this page uses Starknet's testnet.

For testnet transactions you can fund your wallet using the https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/[Starknet Goerli Faucet].

=== Creating a Signer

A Signer is a smart contract that can sign transactions. It's a crucial component of accounts in Starknet. To create a Signer you will need the private key of your smart wallet (the public key can be derived from it).

Starkli has the ability to create a keystore file that securely stores the private key of smart wallets each with a password. The accounts in the keystore file can be used to sign transactions using Starkli. The main advantage of this approach
is that it prevents storing the private key as plain text on your computer. Instead, a password is used to create an encrypted file in a location of choice.

Normally, the keystore file is stored in the default location of the Starkli CLI.

==== Creating a keystore file

The following command creates a keystore file for a smart wallet in the default location in `~/.starkli-wallets/deployer`:

Create a new directory:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer
----

Create a keystore file within the directory:

[source,shell]
----
starkli signer keystore from-key ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json

Enter private key:
Enter password:
Created new encrypted keystore file: /home/parallels/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
Public key: 0x0550…
----

[NOTE]
====
In the private key prompt, paste the private key of your smart wallet.

In the password prompt, enter a password of your choice.

You will need this password to sign transactions using Starkli.
====

==== Export the private key from your wallet

Next export the private key from your Argent X or Braavos wallet:

==== Argent X
Navigate to: `Settings` section -> Select your Account -> `Export Private Key`.

==== Braavos
Navigate to: `Settings` section -> `Privacy and Security` -> `Export Private Key`.

While knowing the private key of a smart wallet is necessary to sign transactions, it's not sufficient. We also need to inform Starkli about the signing mechanism employed by our smart wallet created by Argent X or Braavos.

=== Creating an Account Descriptor

Starkli offers a command to collect all the required information from a smart wallet by providing its onchain address. Using this data, the CLI generates a json file that can be used to sign transactions:

[source,shell]
----
starkli account fetch --help
Fetch account config from an already deployed account contract
----


The `fetch` command supports both Argent X and Braavos smart wallets. Make sure your wallet address is already deployed and input following command to create and save the account descriptor file:

[source,shell]
----
starkli account fetch <SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS> --output ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json
----

The following command shows the details of the account descriptor:

[source,shell]
----
cat ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json
----

The account descriptor should have the following structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "variant": {
        "type": "argent",
        "version": 1,
        "implementation": "<ARGENT_CLASS_HASH>",
        "signer": "<SMART_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY>",
        "guardian": "0x0"
  },
    "deployment": {
        "status": "deployed",
        "class_hash": "<SMART_WALLET_CLASS_HASH>",
        "address": "<SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS>"
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are working with Braavos wallet, the type is defined as `braavos` and the account descriptor structure might be slightly different.
====

== Deploying an account
Once you have an account file, you can deploy the account contract with the starkli `account deploy` command.

This command sends a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction, which requires the account to be funded with some ETH for paying for the transaction fee.

To deploy your account, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
starkli account deploy ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json
----

[NOTE]
====
This command requires a signer. If you receive an error after running this command, ensure you have the `STARKNET_KEYSTORE` environment variable set as per xref:environment_setup.adoc#setting_up_starkli_environment_variables[these instructions].
====


When run, the command shows:

* The address where the contract will be deployed.
* Instructions for the user to fund the account before proceeding.

Here's an example command output:

[source,bash]
----
The estimated account deployment fee is 0.000011483579723913 ETH. However, to avoid failure, fund at least:
    0.000017225369585869 ETH
to the following address:
    0x01cf4d57ba01109f018dec3ea079a38fc08b789e03de4df937ddb9e8a0ff853a
Press [ENTER] once youve funded the address.
----

You have now successfully deployed a new account to Starknet.
