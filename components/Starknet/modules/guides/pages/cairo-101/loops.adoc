= Loops

The `loop` keyword tells Cairo to loop and execute a block of code until you explicitly told to to stop.

The `while` keyword tells Cairo to loop and execute a block of code as long as a condition is met.

The `for` keyword tells Cairo to loop and execute a block of code over for each item in a collection.

=== Example

[source,cairo]
----
fn main() {
    let mut res: u8 = 1;
    loop {
        if res == 5 {
            break;
        }
        res += 1;
    };
    assert!(res == 5);
    while res != 1 {
        res -= 1;
    };
    assert!(res == 1);
    for n in 1..5_u8 { // Range of 1 to 5
        assert!(res == n);
        res += 1;
    };
}
