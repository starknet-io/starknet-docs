= Constants

Constants store data that cannot be modified, just like immutable variables. However, unlike immutable variables:

* Constants are declared using the `const` keyword
* Constants do not allow using the `mut` keyword (i.e., constant are not only immutable by default, but are _always_ immutable)
* Constants require explicit type annotation
* Constants must be set to a constant expressions (and not the result of a value that can only be computed at runtime)

Moreover:

* Constants can be declared in the global scope
* Constants use the `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` form by convention

=== Example

----
// const mut ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS = 60*60; <-- fails to compile
const ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 3600;

fn main() {
    assert!(ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS == 60*60);
}
