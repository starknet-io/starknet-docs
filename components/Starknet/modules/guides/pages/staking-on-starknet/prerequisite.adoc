= Setting up your environment

== Introduction

Welcome to the third installment of the _Becoming a Starknet validator_ guide! ✅

There are four prerequisites before proceeding to next steps.

* Docker = Docker is a free and widely-used platform that allows us to run node clients in isolated, reproducible environments. It’s the preferred deployment method for many node client providers due to its consistency, portability, and ease of setup. Visit https://docs.docker.com/desktop/[docker desktop^] to install Docker for your OS. 

* Browser Wallet  = We need up to two wallet addresses that will be needed in xref:staking-on-starknet/stake.adoc[] and xref:staking-on-starknet/block-attestation.adoc[] sections. You can use any browser wallet of your choice such as https://www.argent.xyz/download-argent[Argent^] or https://braavos.app/download-braavos-wallet/[Braavos^].

* Make sure both wallet addresses have some testnet STRK tokens. You can visit the https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/[faucet page^] to request STRK.  

* We need Ethereum Sepolia Websocket RPC URL to allow communication between our validator and sepolia testnet. You can create an account with https://www.alchemy.com/[Alchemy^], https://www.infura.io/[Infura^] or https://www.quicknode.com/[Quicknode^] to get your free RPC. 

With these steps complete, you're now ready to launch your first validator!
