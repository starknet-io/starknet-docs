= Setting up your environment

== Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter on running your first node on Starknet! Treat this chapter as a compiled prerequisite for upcoming chapters. Feel free to come back to this chapter in case you accidentally skipped over a step. 

There are four prerequisites before proceeding to next steps.

* Docker = Docker is a free and widely-used platform that allows us to run node clients in isolated, reproducible environments. Itâ€™s the preferred deployment method for many node client providers due to its consistency, portability, and ease of setup. Visit https://docs.docker.com/desktop/[docker desktop^] to install Docker for your OS. 

* Browser Wallet  = We need up to two wallet addresses that will be needed in xref:staking-on-starknet/stake.adoc[] and xref:staking-on-starknet/block-attestation.adoc[] sections. You can use any browser wallet of your choice such as https://www.argent.xyz/download-argent[Argent^] or https://braavos.app/download-braavos-wallet/[Braavos^].

* Make sure both wallet addresses have some testnet STRK tokens. You can visit the https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/[faucet page^] to request STRK.  

* We need Ethereum Sepolia Websocket RPC URL to allow communication between our validator and sepolia testnet. You can create an account with https://www.alchemy.com/[Alchemy^], https://www.infura.io/[Infura^] or https://www.quicknode.com/[Quicknode^] to get your free RPC. 

With these steps complete, you're now ready to launch your first validator!
