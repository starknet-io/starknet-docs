= Running a full node

== Introduction

Welcome to the third installment of the _Becoming a Starknet validator_ guide! âœ…

To claim your staking rewards, you must run one of the various xref:ecosystem:fullnodes-rpc-providers.adoc#full_nodes[Starknet full node implementations]. This installment of the series will therefore walk you though running a Pathfinder full node.

== Downloading a database snapshot

Running a full node involves using your local machine's storage to maintain a full database of the blockchain, all the way from the genesis block.

Database snapshots let you quickly start your node without having to download all blocks from the very beginning, and instead use a pre-made version of the database that's already in sync up to a certain block.

To download Pathfinder's snapshot, you first need to download the https://rclone.org/[rclone^] file manager by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
----

[NOTE]
====
This installation script can be used to install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems. For other installation methods, see https://rclone.org/install/[rclone.org/install^].
====

Once rclone is downloaded, create a new rclone configuration file: 

[source,terminal]
----
touch $HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
----

and add the following content:

[source,terminal]
----
[pathfinder-snapshots]
type = s3
provider = Cloudflare
env_auth = false
access_key_id = 7635ce5752c94f802d97a28186e0c96d
secret_access_key = 529f8db483aae4df4e2a781b9db0c8a3a7c75c82ff70787ba2620310791c7821
endpoint = https://cbf011119e7864a873158d83f3304e27.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
acl = private
----

Next, create a new `$HOME/pathfinder` directory, navigate into it, and use rclone to copy https://rpc.pathfinder.equilibrium.co/snapshots/latest[Pathfinder's latest database snapshot^] to your local directory by running:

[source,terminal]
----
mkdir $HOME/pathfinder
cd $HOME/pathfinder
rclone copy -P pathfinder-snapshots:pathfinder-snapshots/<FILENAME> . 
----

Once the database snapshot is downloaded, compare the file's checksum value with the one shown at https://rpc.pathfinder.equilibrium.co/snapshots/latest[rpc.pathfinder.equilibrium.co/snapshots/latest^] by running:

[source,terminal]
----
sha256sum <FILENAME> 
----

If the checksum values match, extract the downloaded database snapshot by running:

[source,terminal]
----
zstd -T0 -d EXACT_FILE_NAME -o testnet-sepolia.sqlite
----

== Running the node

Now that the database snapshot is extracted, you can start your node by running:

[source,terminal]
----
docker run \
  --name pathfinder \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --detach \
  -p 9545:9545 \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e RUST_LOG=info \
  -e <ETHEREUM_ENDPOINT> \
  -v $HOME/pathfinder:/usr/share/pathfinder/data \
  eqlabs/pathfinder
----

Once the docker container is up and running, you can check the docker image's logs by running: 

[source,terminal]
---- 
docker logs -f pathfinder
---- 

If successful, the result should resemble the following:

[source,terminal]
---- 
...
2025-05-12T18:30:36  INFO Updated Starknet state with block 766534
2025-05-12T18:31:07  INFO Updated Starknet state with block 766535
2025-05-12T18:31:35  INFO Updated Starknet state with block 766536
...
---- 

[NOTE]
====
To stop the node's execution, run:

[source,terminal]
----
docker stop pathfinder
----

// == Next step

// Congratulations, you are now running your own Starknet Sepolia node! However, your node is not a validator yet. We will get there eventually. 

// Next, we will be interacting with the staking contract to stake our STRK tokens and assigning our operation and reward addresses. Let's jump in!
