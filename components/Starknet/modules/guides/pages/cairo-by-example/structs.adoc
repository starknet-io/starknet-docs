= Structs

Structs, which stands for "structures", can be created with the `struct` keyword using a classic C structs syntax. Variables named similar to a struct's members allow to use a shorter syntax, and struct update syntax allows to use fields of other structs.

Dot notation is used to get a specific value from a struct.
