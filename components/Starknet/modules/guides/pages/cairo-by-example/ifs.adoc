= `if` expressions

An `if` expression is a control flow construct that allow us to conditionally execute a piece of code depending on the value of a boolean condition. Since it is an expression, it returns the value of the last expression in the branch.

You can combine several conditions using boolean operators like `&&` (and), `||` (or), etc. You can also add an optional `else` branch like in many other programming languages.
