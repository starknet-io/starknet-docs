= Integers

It is highly recommended to use integer types where possible, as they come with extra protection against potential vulnerabilities in the code, such as overflow checks.

Integer types include `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, and `i256` for signed integers and `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, and `u256` for unsigned integers, and may be annotated via a suffix.

Integer division is truncated down to the nearest integer.

fn main() {
    let a: u64 = 56;  // Regular annotation
    let b = 32_u64; // Suffix annotation
    assert!(a / b == 1);
    assert!(b / a == 0);
