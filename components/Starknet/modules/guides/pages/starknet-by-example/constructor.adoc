# Constructor

A constructor is a special function that initializes a contract's state during deployment. It has several key characteristics:

- Runs exactly once when the contract is deployed
- Must be annotated with `#[constructor]`
- Up to one constructor per contract
- Function is conventionally named `constructor`

Here's an example that shows how to initialize storage variables during contract deployment:

```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod ConstructorContract {
    // This trait is necessary to be able to write to a specific storage variable
    use starknet::storage::StoragePointerWriteAccess;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        a: u128,
        b: u8,
        c: u256,
    }

    // The constructor is decorated with a `#[constructor]` attribute.
    // It is not inside an `impl` block.
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, a: u128, b: u8, c: u256) {
        self.a.write(a);
        self.b.write(b);
        self.c.write(c);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The constructor takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`
- Each parameter corresponds to a storage variable of the same name, but you can specify any argument variable name
- The values are written to storage using the `write()` method. You need to import the `StoragePointerWriteAccess` trait to be able to write to a specific storage pointer

[TIP]
====
Constructors are ideal for:

- Setting initial contract state
- Storing deployment-time parameters
- Initializing access control (e.g., setting an owner)

[WARNING]
====
Constructor values cannot be changed after deployment unless you specifically implement functions to modify them.
