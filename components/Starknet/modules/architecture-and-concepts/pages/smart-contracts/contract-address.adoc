[id="contract_address"]
= Contract address

The contract address is a unique identifier of the contract on Starknet. It is a chain hash of the following information:

[horizontal,labelwidth="26",role=stripes-odd]
`prefix`:: The ASCII encoding of the constant string `STARKNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.
`deployer_address`:: One of the following:
* When the contract is deployed via a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction: `0`
* When the contract is deployed via a `deploy` system call from another contract, the value of the `deploy_from_zero` parameter determines this value.
+
For information on the `deploy_from_zero` parameter, see the xref:smart-contracts/system-calls-cairo1.adoc#deploy[`deploy` system call]
`salt`:: The salt passed by the contract calling the syscall, provided by the transaction sender.
`class_hash`:: See xref:./class-hash.adoc#computing_the_cairo_1_class_hash[the class hash documentation].
`constructor_calldata_hash`:: xref:cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen_array_hash[Array hash] of the inputs to the constructor.

The address is computed as follows:

[source,]
----
contract_address = pedersen(
    “STARKNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS”,
    deployer_address,
    salt,
    class_hash,
    constructor_calldata_hash)
----

[NOTE]
====
A random `salt` ensures unique addresses for smart contract deployments, preventing conflicts when deploying identical contract classes.

It also thwarts replay attacks by influencing the transaction hash with a unique sender address.
