= System Calls

Writing smart contracts requires various associated operations, such as calling another contract or
accessing the contract's storage, that standalone programs do not require. The Starknet contract language supports these operations by using system calls. System calls enable a contract to require services from the Starknet OS. You can use system calls in a function to get information that depends on the broader state of Starknet, which would otherwise be inaccessible, rather than local variables that appear in the function's scope.

Gets information about the currently executing block and the transactions in the block. For a complete description of this information, see xref:#block_execution_info[]

This single system call contains all information for a block, transaction, and execution context.

When an account's `+__validate__+`, `+__validate_deploy__+`, or `+__validate_declare__+` function calls `get_execution_info`, the return values for `block_timestamp` and `block_number` are modified as follows:

* `block_timestamp` returns the hour, rounded down to the nearest hour.
* `block_number` returns the block number, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 100.

----

[discrete]
=== Description

Calls a given contract. This system call expects the address of the called contract, a selector for a function within that contract, and call arguments.

[NOTE]
====
An internal call can't return `Err(_)` as this is not handled by the sequencer and the Starknet OS.

If `call_contract_syscall` fails, this can't be caught and will therefore result in the entire transaction being reverted.
====

[discrete]
=== Arguments

[horizontal,labelwidth=35]
`_address_: ContractAddress`:: The address of the contract you want to call.
`_entry_point_selector_: felt252`:: A selector for a function within that contract.
`_calldata_: Span<felt252>`:: The calldata array.

[discrete]
=== Return values

* The call response, of type `SyscallResult<Span<felt252>>`.

`_deploy_from_zero_: bool`:: A flag that determines whether the deployerâ€™s address affects the computation of the contract address. When not set, or when set to `FALSE`, the caller address is used as the new contract's deployer address. When set to `TRUE`, 0 is used.

[discrete]
=== Return values

=== Function signature

[source,cairo,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
extern fn replace_class_syscall(
    class_hash: ClassHash
) -> SyscallResult<()> implicits(GasBuiltin, System) nopanic;
----

[discrete]
=== Description
Once `replace_class` is called, the class of the calling contract (i.e. the contract whose address is returned by `get_contract_address` at the time the syscall is called) will be replaced
by the class whose hash is given by the class_hash argument.

[NOTE]
====
After calling `replace_class`, the code currently executing from the old class will finish running.


The new class will be used from the next transaction onwards or if the contract is called via
the `call_contract` syscall in the same transaction (after the replacement).
====

[discrete]
=== Arguments

[horizontal,labelwidth=35]
`class_hash_: ClassHash`:: The hash of the class you want to use as a replacement.

----
extern fn storage_read_syscall(

) -> SyscallResult<felt252> implicits(GasBuiltin, System) nopanic;
----

[discrete]
=== Description

Gets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract.

This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with `var.read()`, which enables you to read storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract.

For information on accessing storage by using the storage variables, see xref:./contract-storage.adoc#storage_variables[storage variables].

[discrete]
=== Arguments

[horizontal,labelwidth=35]
`_address_domain_: u32`:: The domain of the key, used to separate between different data availability modes. This separation is used in Starknet to offer different data availability modes. Currently, only the onchain mode (where all updates go to L1), indicated by domain `0`, is supported. Other address domains which will be introduced in the future will behave differently in terms of publication (in particular, they will not be posted on L1, creating a tradeoff between cost and security).
`_address_: StorageAddress`:: The requested storage address.

[discrete]
=== Return values

* The value of the key, of type `SyscallResult<felt252>`.

[discrete]
=== Common library

----

[discrete]
=== Description

Sets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract.

This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with `var.write()`, which enables you to write to storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract.

For information on accessing storage by using the storage variables, see xref:./contract-storage.adoc#storage_variables[storage variables].

[discrete]
=== Arguments

[horizontal,labelwidth=35]
`_address_domain_: u32`:: The domain of the key, used to separate between different data availability modes. This separation is used in Starknet to offer different data availability modes.

----
extern fn keccak_syscall(

----

[discrete]
=== Description

Computes the link:https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/cryptography/hash-functions/#starknet_keccak[Keccak-256 hash] of the input data.

This system call is particularly useful when interacting with Ethereum contracts or implementing Ethereum-compatible functionality, as Keccak-256 is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Note that instead of using this syscall directly, it is recommended to use the functions provided in link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/67c6eff9c276d11bd1cc903d7a3981d8d0eb2fa2/corelib/src/keccak.cairo[`keccak.cairo`] which provide a more convenient interface and handle the syscall under the hood.

[discrete]
=== Arguments

[horizontal,labelwidth=35]
`_data_: Span<felt252>`:: The input data to be hashed, represented as an array of field elements.

[discrete]
=== Return values

* The Keccak-256 hash of the input data as a `u256` value.

The following example demonstrates how to compute a Keccak-256 hash using the recommended functions from `keccak.cairo`:

[source,cairo]
----
use array::ArrayTrait;
use keccak::keccak_u256s_le_inputs;

// Create input data
let mut data = ArrayTrait::new();
data.append(1_u256);
data.append(2_u256);

// Compute Keccak hash using the recommended function
let hash = keccak_u256s_le_inputs(data.span());
