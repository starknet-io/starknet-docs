= Serialization of Cairo types

When you interact with contracts, especially if you are a library or SDK developer that wants to construct transactions, you need to understand how Cairo handles types that are larger than 252 bits so you can correctly formulate the calldata in a transaction.

The field element (`felt252`), which contains 252 bits, is the only actual type in the Cairo VM. So all high-level Cairo types that are larger than 252 bits, such as `u256` or arrays, are ultimately represented by a list of felts. In order to interact with a contract, you need to know how to encode its arguments as a list of felts so you can correctly formulate the calldata in the transaction.
SDKs, such as starknet.js, encode the calldata for you, so you can simply specify any type and the SDK properly formulates the calldata. For example, you donâ€™t need to know that a `u256` value is represented by two `felt252` values. You can simply specify a single integer in your code, and the SDK takes care of the serialization and encoding.


[#data_types_of_252_bits_or_less]
== Data types of 252 bits or less

The following types are smaller than 252 bits. For these types, each value is serialized as a single-member list that contains one `felt252` value.

* `ContractAddress`
* `EthAddress`
* `StorageAddress`
* `ClassHash`
* Unsigned integers smaller than 252 bits: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, and `usize`
* `bytes31`
* `felt252`
* Signed integers smaller than 252 bits: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, and `i128`.
+
A negative value, stem:[-x], is serialized as stem:[P-x], where:
+
[stem]
++++
P = 2^{251} + 17*2^{192} + 1
++++
+
For example, `-5` is serialized as stem:[P-5]. For more information on the value of stem:[P], see xref:architecture-and-concepts:cryptography/p-value.adoc[The STARK field].


[#data_types_greater_than_252_bits]
== Data types greater than 252 bits

The following Cairo data types have non-trivial serialization:

* `u256` and `u512`
* arrays
* enums
* structs
* `ByteArray`, which represents strings


[#serialization_of_unsigned_integers]
== Serialization of unsigned integers

Among unsigned integers, only `u256` and `u512` have non-trivial serialization.

[#serialization_in_u256_values]
=== Serialization of `u256` values

A `u256` value in Cairo is represented by two `felt252` values, as follows:

* The first `felt252` value contains the 128 least significant bits, usually referred to as the low part of the original `u256` value.
* The second `felt252` value contains the 128 most significant bits, usually referred to as the high part of the original `u256` value.

For example:

* A `u256` variable whose decimal value is `2` is serialized as `[2,0]`. To understand why, examine the binary representation of `2` and split it into two 128-bit parts, as follows:
+
[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{128 high bits}} |
\underbrace{0\cdots10}_{\text{128 low bits}}
++++
//
// [#binary_representation_of_u256]
// .Binary representation of `2` in a serialized `u256`
// [%autowidth,cols="2"]
// |===
// |`felt252`~1~ = `0`~binary~ = `0`~decimal~|`felt252`~2~ = `10`~binary~ = `2~decimal~`
//
// a|//`0b000...000`
// [stem]
// ++++
// \underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{128 bits}}
// ++++
// a| //`0b000...000`
// [stem]
// ++++
// \underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{128 bits}}
// \underbrace{0\cdots10}_{\text{128 bits}}
// ++++
// |===

* A `u256` variable whose decimal value is `2^128^` is serialized as `[0,1]`. To understand why, examine the binary representation of `2^128^` and split it into two 128-bit parts, as follows:
+
[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots01}_{\text{128 high bits}} |
\underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{128 low bits}}
++++

* A `u256` variable whose decimal value is `2^129^+2^128^+20`, is serialized as `[20,3]`. To understand why, examine the binary representation of the `2^129^+2^128^+20` and split it into two 128-bit parts, as follows:
+
[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots011}_{\text{128 high bits}} |
\underbrace{0\cdots10100}_{\text{128 low bits}}
++++

[#serialization_in_u512_values]
=== Serialization of `u512` values

The `u512` type in Cairo is a struct containing four `felt252` members, each representing a 128-bit limb of the original integer, similar to the `u256` type.


[#serialization_of_arrays]
== Serialization of arrays

Arrays are serialized as follows:

`<__array_length__>, <__serialized_member_0__>,..., <__serialized_member_n__>`

For example, consider the following array of `u256` values:

[source,cairo]
----
let POW_2_128: u256 = 0x100000000000000000000000000000000
let array: Array<u256> = array![10, 20, POW_2_128]
----

Each `u256` value in the array is represented by two `felt252` values. So the array above is serialized as follows:

[stem]
++++
\underbrace{3}_{\textit{number_of_array_members}} ,
\underbrace{10,0}_{\textit{serialized_member_0}} ,
\underbrace{20,0}_{\textit{serialized_member_1}} ,
\underbrace{0,1}_{\textit{serialized_member_2}}
++++

Combining the above, the array is serialized as follows: `[3,10,0,20,0,0,1]`

[#serialization_of_enums]
== Serialization of enums

An enum is serialized as follows:

`<__index_of_enum_variant__>,<__serialized_variant__>`

.Enum serialization example 1

Consider the following definition of an enum named `Week`:

[source,cairo]
----
enum Week {
    Sunday: (), // Index=0. The variant type is the unit type.
    Monday: u256, // Index=1. The variant type is u256.
}
----

Now consider instantiations of the `Week` enum's variants as shown in the table xref:#serialization_of_Week[]:

[#serialization_of_Week]
.Serialization of `Week` variants

[cols=",,",]
|===
|Instance |Description |Serialization

|`Week::Sunday` | Index=`0`. The variant's type is the unit type. | `[1]`
|`Week::Monday(5)` a| Index=`1`. The variant's type is `u256`.| `[2,5,0]`
|===

.Enum serialization example 2

Consider the following definition of an enum named `MessageType`:

[source,cairo]
----
enum MessageType {
    A,
    #[default]
    B: u128,
    C
}
----

Now consider instantiations of the `MessageType` enum's variants as shown in the table xref:#serialization_of_MessageType[]:

[#serialization_of_MessageType]
.Serialization of `MessageType` variants
[cols=",,",]
|===
|Instance |Description |Serialization

|`MessageType::A` | Index=`1`. The variant's type is the unit type. | `[1]`
|`MessageType::B(6)` a| Index=`0`. The variant's type is `u128`. | `[0,6]`
|`MessageType::C` | Index=`2`. The variant's type is the unit type. | `[2]`
|===

[#serialization_of_structs]
== Serialization of structs

You serialize a struct by serializing its members one at a time.

Its members are serialized in the order in which they  appear in the definition of the struct.


For example, consider the following definition of the struct `MyStruct`:

[source,cairo]
----
struct MyStruct {
    a: u256,
    b: felt252,
    c: Array<felt252>
}

----

The serialization is the same for both of the following instantiations of the struct's members:

[cols="2"]
|===
a|[source,cairo]
----
let my_struct = MyStruct {
    a: 2, b: 5, c: [1,2,3]
};
----

a|[source,cairo]
----
let my_struct = MyStruct {
    b: 5, c: [1,2,3], a: 2
};
----
|===

The serialization of `MyStruct` is determined as shown in the table xref:#serialization_for_a_struct_in_cairo[].

[#serialization_for_a_struct_in_cairo]
.Serialization for a struct in Cairo
[cols="3"]
|===
|Member |Description |Serialization

| `a: 2`
| For information on serializing `u256` values, see xref:#serialization_in_u256_values[]
| [`2,0`]
| `b: 5`
| One `felt252` value
| `5`
| `c: [1,2,3]`
| An array of three `felt252` values
| [`3,1,2,3`]
|===

Combining the above, the struct is serialized as follows: `[0,2,5,3,1,2,3]`

[#serialization_of_byte_arrays]
== Serialization of byte arrays

A string is represented in Cairo as a `ByteArray` type. A byte array is actually a struct with the following members:

. *`data: Array<felt252>`* +
Contains 31-byte chunks of the byte array. Each `felt252` value has exactly 31 bytes. If the number of bytes in the byte array is less than 31, then this array is empty.

. *`pending_word: felt252`* +
The bytes that remain after filling the `data` array with full 31-byte chunks. The pending word consists of at most 30 bytes.


. *`pending_word_len: usize`* +
The number of bytes in `pending_word`.

.Example 1: A string shorter than 31 characters

Consider the string `hello`, whose ASCII encoding is the 5-byte hex value `0x68656c6c6f`. The resulting byte array is serialized as follows:

[source,cairo]
----

    0, // Number of 31-byte words in the data array.
    0x68656c6c6f, // Pending word
    5 // Length of the pending word, in bytes

----

.Example 2: A string longer than 31 bytes

Consider the string `Long string, more than 31 characters.`, which is represented by the following hex values:

* `0x4c6f6e6720737472696e672c206d6f7265207468616e203331206368617261` (31-byte word)
* `0x63746572732e` (6-byte pending word)

The resulting byte array is serialized as follows:

[source,cairo]
----
    1, // Number of 31-byte words in the array construct.
    0x4c6f6e6720737472696e672c206d6f7265207468616e203331206368617261, // 31-byte word.
    0x63746572732e, // Pending word
    6 // Length of the pending word, in bytes
----
