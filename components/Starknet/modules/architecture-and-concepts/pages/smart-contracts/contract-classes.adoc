= Contract classes and instances

As in object-oriented programming, Starknet distinguishes between a contract and its implementation by separating contracts into classes and instances.

== Contract classes

A _contract class_ is the definition of a contract. It includes Cairo byte code, hint information, entry point names, and everything that defines its semantics.

Each class is uniquely identified by its _class hash_, comparable to a class name in traditional object-oriented programming languages.

== Contract instances

A _contract instance_ is a deployed contract that corresponds to a class. Only contract instances act as true contracts, in that they have their own storage and can be called by transactions or other contracts.

A contract class does not necessarily have a deployed instance in Starknet.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A contract class does not necessarily require a deployed instance in Starknet.
====

A contract instance has a nonce, the value of which is the number of transactions originating from this address plus 1. For example, when you deploy an account with a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction, the nonce of the account contract in the transaction is `0`. After the `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction, until the account contract sends its next transaction, the nonce is `1`.

== Working with classes

[horizontal,labelwidth=20,role="stripes-odd"]
Adding new classes:: To introduce new classes to Starknet's state, use the `DECLARE` transaction.

Deploying instances:: To deploy a new instance of a previously declared class, use the `deploy` system call.

Using class functionality:: To use the functionality of a declared class without deploying an instance, use the `library_call` system call. Analogous to Ethereum's `delegatecall`, it enables you to use code in an existing class without deploying a contract instance.
