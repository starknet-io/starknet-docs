= Simplified transaction flow

The key stages of transaction lifetime are:

. The sequencer selects a transaction from the mempool and calls the `+__validate__+` function.
. If the transaction is valid, the sequencer calls the `+__execute__+` function.
. If `+__execute__+` runs successfully, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block, charges the fee, and proceeds to work on the next transaction.
. After completing the block, the sequencer sends the block to the prover.

== The payment mechanism

The sequencer receives fees in ETH in return for including transactions in a block.

For more details on how the transaction fee is computed, see xref:../network-architecture/fee-mechanism.adoc[Gas and transaction fees].
