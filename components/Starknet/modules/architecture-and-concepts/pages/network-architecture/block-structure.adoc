[id="block_structure"]
= Block structure

A Starknet block is a list of transactions and a block header that contains the following fields:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

|`block_number` | `u64` | The number, that is, the height, of this block.

| `parent_block_hash` | `felt252` | The hash of the block's parent.

| `global_state_root` | `felt252` | The xref:../network-architecture/starknet-state.adoc#state_commitment[state commitment] after the block.

|`sequencer_address` | `ContractAddress` | The Starknet address of the sequencer that created the block.

| `block_timestamp` | `Timestamp` | The time at which the sequencer began building the block, in seconds since the Unix epoch.

|`transaction_count` | `u32` | The number of transactions in the block.

|`events_count` | `u32` | The number of events in the block.

|`state_diff_length`| `u32` | The sum of number of storage diffs, nonce updates, deployed contracts and declared classes.

|`state_diff_commitment`| `felt252` | The poseidon hash of the state diff of the block, see below for more details.

| `transactions_commitment` | `felt252` | A commitment to the transactions included in the block.
The root of a height-64 binary Merkle Patricia trie. The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to stem:[$${h(\text{transaction_hash}, \text{signature})}$$].

| `events_commitment` | `felt252` | The root of a height-64 binary Merkle Patricia trie. 
The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to the hash of the stem:[$i'th$] event emitted in the block.
See below for a description on how event hashes are computed.

| `receipts_commitment`| `felt252` | The root of a height-64 Merkle-Patricia trie. 
The leaf at index stem:[$i$] corresponds to the hash of the stem:[$i'th$] transaction receipt.
See below for a description on how receipt hashes are computed.

| `l1_gas_price` | `(u128, u128)` | The price of L1 gas that was used while constructing the block. L1 gas prices apply to storage updates and L1->L2 messages. As of March 2023, computation is also priced in terms of L1 gas, but this will change in the future.
The first `u128` value is the price in wei. The second is the price in fri.

| `l1_data_gas_price` | `(u128, u128)` | The price of L1 blob gas that was used while constructing the block. If the `l1_da_mode` of the block is set to `BLOB`, L1 blob gas prices determines the storage update cost.
The first `u128` value is the price in wei. The second is the price in fri.

| `l1_da_mode` | `String` | `CALLDATA` or `BLOB`, depending on how Starknet state diffs are sent to L1.

| `protocol_version` | `String` | The version of the Starknet protocol used when creating the block.

[#block_hash]
== Block hash

A block hash is defined as the Poseidon hash of the header's fields, as follows:

[,,subs="quotes"]
----
_h_(ùêµ) = _h_(
    "STARKNET_BLOCK_HASH0",
    block_number,
    global_state_root,
    sequencer_address,
    block_timestamp,
    transaction_count || event_count || state_diff_length || l1_da_mode,
    state_diff_commitment,
    transactions_commitment
    events_commitment,
    l1_gas_price_in_wei,
    l1_gas_price_in_fri,
    l1_data_gas_price_in_wei,
    l1_data_gas_price_in_fri
    receipts_commitment
    0,
    parent_block_hash
)
----

Where:

- `_h_` is the xref:../../cryptography/hash-functions.adoc#poseidon-hash[Poseidon hash].
- `||` denotes concatenation, `transaction_count`, `event_count` and `state_diff_length` are given 64 bits each, and `l1_da_mode` is one bit where 0 denotes `CALLDATA` and 1 denotes `BLOB`.

[#state_diff_hash]
== State diff commitment

The state diff commitment is obtained by the chain-hash of the following:

- updates to contract addresses stem:[$c_1,...,c_n$], with diffs stem:[$(k^1_1, v^1_1),...,(k^1_{m_1}, v^1_{m_1}),...,(k^n_1, v^n_1),...,(k^n_{m_n},v^n_{m_n})$]
- deployed contracts stem:[$(\text{deployed_address}_1, \text{deployed_class_hash}_1),...,(\text{deployed_address}_\ell,\text{deployed_class_hash}_\ell)$]
- declared classes stem:[$(\text{declared_class_hash}_1, \text{declared_compiled_class_hash}_1), ..., (\text{declared_class_hash}_d, \text{declared_compiled_class_hash}_d)$]
- replaced classes stem:[$(\text{replaced_contract_address}_1, \text{new_class_hash}_1),...,(\text{replaced_contract_address}_r, \text{new_class_hash}_r)$]
- updated nonces stem:[$(\text{account}_1, \text{new_nonce}_1),...,(\text{account}_k, \text{new_nonce}_k)$]

More formally, the state-diff hash is given by:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
h\big( & \text{"STARKNET_STATE_DIFF0"}, \\
& \quad \ell + r, \\
& \quad \text{deployed_address}_1, \text{deployed_class_hash}_1,...,\text{deployed_address}_\ell,\text{deployed_class_hash}_\ell, \\
& \quad \text{replaced_contract_address}_1, \text{new_class_hash}_1,...,\text{replaced_contract_address}_r, \text{new_class_hash}_r \\
& \quad d, \\
& \quad \text{declared_class_hash}_1, \text{declared_compiled_class_hash}_1, ..., \text{declared_class_hash}_d, \text{declared_compiled_class_hash}_d, \\
& \quad 1, \\
& \quad 0, \\
& \quad n, \\
& \quad c_1 \\
& \quad k^1_1, v^1_1,...,k^1_{m_1}, v^1_{m_1} \\
& \quad \vdots \\
& \quad c_n \\
& \quad k^n_1, v^n_1,...,k^n_{m_n},v^n_{m_n} \\
& \quad k \\
& \quad \text{account}_1, \text{new_nonce}_1,...,\text{account}_k, \text{new_nonce}_k\big)
\end{align}
++++

Where:

- stem:[$h$] is the  Poseidon hash function
- stem:[$1, 0$] in the hash computation are placeholders that may be used in the future

[#receipt_hash]
== Receipt hash

A transaction receipt consists of the following fields:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `transaction_hash` | `felt252` | the hash of the transaction
| `actual_fee` | `u128` | the fee paid on-chain
| `events` | `List<Event>` | ordered list of the events emitted by the transaction
| `messages` | `List<L2toL1Message>` | ordered list of the l2->l1 messages sent by the transaction
| `revert_reason`| `String`| The revert reason, in case the transaction was reverted
| `l1_gas_consumed`| `u128` | The amount of l1 gas that was consumed
| `l1_data_gas_consumed`| `u128` | The amount of l1 data (blob) gas that was consumed
| `l2_gas_consumed`| `u128` | The amount of l2 gas that was consumed

|===

The hash of the transaction receipt is given by:

[,,subs="quotes"]
----
_h_(receipt) = _h_(
    transaction_hash,
    actual_fee,
    h(messages),
    sn_keccak(revert_reason),
    h(l2_gas_consumed, l1_gas_consumed, l1_data_gas_consumed)
)
----

Where:

- h is the Poseidon hash function
- given messages stem:[$m_1=(\text{from}_1, \text{to}_1, \text{payload}_1)...m_n=(\text{from}_n, \text{to}_n, \text{payload}_n)$], their hash is given by:

[stem]
++++
h(n, \text{from}_1, \text{to}_1, h(\text{payload}_1), ..., \text{from}_n, \text{to}_n, h(\text{payload}_n))
++++

where each message's payload is length-prefixed.

- events are omitted from the receipt's hash since they are committed separately in the block.

[#event_hash]
== Event hash

The hash of an event stem:[$(\text{keys}, \text{data})$] emitted by a contract whose address is `emitter_address` and a transaction whose hash is `tx_hash` is given by:

[stem]
++++
h\big(\text{emitter_address}, \text{tx_hash}, h(\text{keys}), h(\text{data}) \big)
++++

Where stem:[$h$] is the Poseidon hash function.

[NOTE]
====
Zeros inside the hash computation of an object are used as placeholders, to be replaced in the future by meaningful fields.
