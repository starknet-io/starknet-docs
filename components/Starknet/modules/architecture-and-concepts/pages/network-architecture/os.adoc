= Starknet operating system (OS)

== Introduction

The Starknet  OS is a key element in Starknet's architecture, but also one of its more complicated components. This page's aim is to gradually walk through what the Starknet OS, how does it work and interact with the Starknet Core contract, and where its implementations can be found. Some parts may require reading more than once, but don't hesitate to https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs/issues/new?assignees=landauraz&title=Feedback%20for%20%22The%20Starknet%20operating%20system%22[reach out^] if you feel further clarification is needed. 

== What is the Starknet OS?

As an L2 validity rollup, Starknet's state on Ethereum can't be updated without proving that all the blocks between the current state and the new state are valid. But what does "proving that a block is valid" mean exactly? Technically, only statements of the form "_Cairo program stem:[P] ran successfully with output stem:[O]_" can be proven, which means that the statement "_Blocks stem:[B] is valid_" needs to expressed in the form of a Cairo program.

This is where the Starknet OS comes in: it is a Cairo Zero program that verifies the validity of blocks by getting an initial state stem:[S] and a list of transactions (i.e., block) stem:[B] as input and outputting the state that is the result of applying stem:[B] on stem:[S].

The Starknet OS is the program required for updating Starknet's state on Ethereum (xref:#starknet_os_and_ethereum[up to some caveats]). As such, is it also the final arbiter on what does it mean for a transaction to execute correctly. For example, while a malicious sequencer can deviate from xref:architecture-and-concepts:network-architecture/transaction-life-cycle.adoc#transaction_flow[the `INVOKE` transaction's behavior] by skipping the execution of `+__validate__+` before `+__execute__+` in the calling account contract, this specification is https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_transactions.cairo#L390[enforced by the Starknet OS^] and therefore this sequencer will not be able to produce the proof for the block in which this transaction was included. 

== How does the Starknet OS work?

=== High-level overview

The following is a rough sketch of the Starknet OS program, starting at https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/os.cairo#L38[os.cairo]'s `main` function:

In broad strokes, the Starknet OS's execution consists of the following steps:

. Preprocessing: preparing the Starknet OS's inputs, which include the various hints that will be needed throughout the execution (for example, 
the Merkle path of every accessed storage slot and the code of every accessed contract) 
. Running the transactions: the bulk of the Starknet OS's execution, where transactions are executed sequentially such that for each transaction:
    * The associated account contract is loaded into the memory and called
    * Inner contracts are called, such that https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_entry_point.cairo#L149[the entry `(contract_address, class_hash)` is added to a global state updates dictionary^] for each loaded contract (which is needed to assert that the loaded code corresponds to the class hash that is part of the state commitment)

[NOTE]
====
Contract calls are in fact done non-deterministically, i.e. the contract's response are guessed and verified later. For more details, see xref:#syscall-mechanism[Syscall mechanism].
====
    
    * State updates are accumulated in the global state updates dictionary
. Verifying that the new commitment corresponds to applying the updates accumulated in the global state updates dictionary to the old commitment (for more details, see the link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/state/state.cairo#L40[`state_update` function in `state.cairo`^]).
. Encoding the state diff and adding it to the output segment for xref:network-architecture/data-availability.adoc[data availability] purposes (for more details, see the link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/output.cairo#L71[`serialize_os_output` function in `output.cairo`^])

[id="syscall-mechanism"]
=== Syscall mechanism

A contract can invoke xref:smart-contracts/system-calls-cairo1.adoc[system calls] throughout its execution, which pass the control from the currently executing contract to the Starknet OS itself. Such operations are required when a contract needs information that does not exist within its code, e.g. accessing the Starknet state to read a storage value or to call another contract.

The Starknet OS's code heavily relies on non-determinism to handle system calls. Whenever a contract invokes some syscall, the request, alongside the guessed response, is recorded in a syscalls array.
At the end of every entry point execution, we go over the syscalls array and verify that the responses were correct (for more details, see the https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_entry_point.cairo#L286[`execute_entry_point` function in `execute_transactions.cairo`^]).

For syscalls such as xref:architecture-and-concepts:smart-contracts/system-calls-cairo1.adoc#get_execution_info[`get_execution_info`], 
which returns the block hash and number, correctness means consistency with the value given to the Starknet OS as input. For contract calls, however, one needs to execute the called contract and verify that the actual response and the guessed response are identical. But how can we guess the responses to all the contract calls before executing them? For that, it is important to distinguish two different styles-of-execution that a Starknet block goes through:

* The first one is done by a sequencer, when constructing the block from incoming transactions
* The second one is done by a prover, when executing the Starknet OS in order to generate a proof for the (already finalized) block

Therefore, when running the OS, we already know what is going to happen: the block has already been executed by the sequencer, and so we know exactly what contracts and storage slots will be accessed, what each internal call will return, and so on.

It's worth noting that in the first execution, the sequencer can run in whatever way he chooses. In fact, he doesn't even have to run through the Cairo VM at all, but rather https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo_native[precompile contracts to machine code and run them natively^]. Moreover, sequencers can also impose restrictions that are not enforced by the Starknet OS. Such discrepancy between the two executions may seem like a bug, but as long as these restrictions only protect the sequencers themselves, rather than the correctness of execution, there is no reason to enforce them in the Starknet OS. A good example for such restriction is the xref:architecture-and-concepts:accounts/account-functions#limitations_of_validation[limits on validation functions] that protect the sequencer from DoS attacks. It is crucial, however, that both executions agree on the execution semantics, since, as mentioned in xref:#introduction[What is the Starknet OS?], the Starknet OS is the final arbiter and if it disagrees on the validity of the block, the sequencer will not be able to produce a proof for that block (and the only way forward would be a reorg on Starknet).

== Starknet OS and the Starknet Core contract

The Starknet Core contract is the contract responsible for storing and updating Starknet's state on Ethereum. As of Starknet v0.13.2 and as part of https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-v0-13-2-pre-release-notes/114223#starknet-applicative-recursion-3[SHARP's applicative recursion feature^], proofs of the Starknet OS's execution are not enough to update the Starknet Core contract. Instead, it is required to submit an "applicative proof" of a different program called https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/cairo/bootloaders/applicative_bootloader/applicative_bootloader.cairo#L15[the applicative bootloader^].

The way the applicative bootloader works is by verifying a proof of one or more executions of a base program stem:[B] and then using their outputs as input to an aggregator program stem:[A]. In the case of Starknet, stem:[B] is the Starknet OS and stem:[A] is a new cairo program that squashes the state diffs of several blocks (the code of which can be found in the https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/aggregator/main.cairo#L8[cairo-lang GitHub repository^]). This way, individual executions of the Starknet OS for some block range can be "squashed" into a single program whose valid execution attests to the validity of all blocks within that range and whose output is the squashed state diff of these blocks.

In order to verify that an "applicative proof" used the correct Starknet OS and aggregator programs, their program hashes must be stored in the Starknet Core contract. As each Starknet version is associated with a given Starknet OS program, this means that breaking protocol changes must be accompanied by an update to the Starknet OS's (and possibly the aggregator's) program hash registered in the Starknet Core contract.

[TIP]
====
The Starknet OS's and aggregator's program hashes in the latest Starknet versions are available in xref:tools:important-addresses.adoc#important_program_hashes[Important program hashes], but you can also read the current program hashes directly from the Starknet Core contract using its `programHash` and `aggregatorProgramHash` functions (for example, https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662c410c0ecf747543f5ba90660f6abebd9c8c4#readProxyContract[via Etherscan^]).
====

Finally, the Starknet Core contract is also responsible for verifying the few things the Starknet OS can't, including:

* Verifying that the state given to the Starknet OS as input is Starknet's current state on Ethereum
* Verifying that all xref:architecture-and-concepts:network-architecture/messaging-mechanism.adoc#l1-l2-messages[L1→L2 messages] were sent on Ethereum

== Implementations

The Cairo code of the Starknet OS is available in the https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/tree/8e11b8cc65ae1d0959328b1b4a40b92df8b58595/src/starkware/starknet/core/os[cairo-lang GitHub repository^]. 
However, this repository does not include all the hints implementiation, which are necessary to locally run the Starknet OS. The current implementation of these hints in Python is now deprecated, and will no longer be maintained in future Starknet versions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As part of the transition of Starknet's infrastructure to Rust, the Starknet OS's Pythonic hints implementiation is deprecated, and will no longer be maintained in future Starknet versions.
====

Instead, a new Rust implementation of the hints, including initializing all inputs of the Starknet OS via a Starknet full node connection, is available in the https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/snos/tree/cb2a6d26faeb658492756fe100bbdf5b1600c768[SNOS GitHub repository^]. At the time of writing, SNOS supports the execution of the Starknet OS for Starknet version 0.13.2.
