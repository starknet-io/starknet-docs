= Exit or Change a Strategy


Once a user owns Strategy tokens, they are free to use them in any way. The first (trivial) option is to hold on to them and profit from their yield. The user can always withdraw them back on-chain; the token's value and yield percentage are the same for off-chain and on-chain holders.

If the user wants to exit the strategy from L2, they have two options:

. The DeFi Pooling Application can implement an off-chain exchange for users to trade their Strategy tokens off-chain with another user for different Strategy tokens (e.g., change your Compound LP tokens for Uniswap LP tokens).
. If multiple users wish to exit a Strategy, the DeFi Pooling Operator can define another Ride to convert Strategy tokens back to Investment tokens (the reverse operation from the previous Ride).
