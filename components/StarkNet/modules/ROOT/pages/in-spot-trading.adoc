== Vault Structure

The vault contains the following fields:

* `starkKey` - the public key of the vault's owner. Transfers and trades that refer to this vault must be signed with this key.
* The `assetId`  that this vault contains (only one type per vault).
* The `amount` ( xref:starkex-specific-concepts.adoc#quantization[quantized])  that this vault contains.&#x20;

[NOTE]
====
In StarkEx for spot trading, every vault contains one asset type. Therefore limit orders get two vaults as input - one vault holds the sold tokens, and the other one receives the bought tokens.
