= About Handling a Full Withdrawal request

StarkEx is a self-custodial platform and as such, it has a censorship resistance mechanism for withdrawal requests and perpetual trade requests. Be sure to monitor the on-chain Full Withdrawal requests and serve them in a timely manner.

[WARNING]
====
If the application censors these requests, your user can freeze your application.
====

During the process of integrating your application with StarkEx, some testing flows check for a mechanism to handle these requests.
