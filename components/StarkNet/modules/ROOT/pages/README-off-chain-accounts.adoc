= Off-Chain Accounts


An off-chain account is the default account for users who use an application powered by StarkEx. These accounts' balances are stored and managed off-chain (except when moving the funds to/from an on-chain account). From the L1 perspective, the funds of these accounts are stored under the StarkEx smart contract.

In this section, we describe the flows that update these accounts. Specifically, a deposit of funds to an L2 account, a transfer of funds to another L2 account, trading tokens from an L2 account, and a withdrawal of funds back to L1.

We also describe flows that the application initiates and might affect these accounts on L2, namely minting off-chain assets for spot trading systems, and liquidation, deleverages and price changes in the perpetual trading systems.
