= StarkEx Playground

Before you begin integrating your own StarkEx instance, get started with the https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-playground-tutorial/[StarkEx Playground]. The Playground provides hands-on experience, shows you how StarkEx works, and introduces you to the StarkEx interface.

The StarkEx playground is an open StarkEx instance deployed on testnet, so anyone can try out StarkEx. You can do the following:

* (Basic) Send a pre-prepared list of transactions to StarkEx and view the resulting on-chain data.
* (Advanced) Build an application and send your own transactions through StarkEx.
