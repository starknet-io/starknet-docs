== Installation
We recommend working inside a Python virtual environment, but you can also install the Cairo package directly. To create and enter the virtual environment, type:

[#setup_starknet_env]
[source,bash]
----
python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
----

Make sure the venv is activated â€“ you should see `(cairo_venv)` in the command line prompt.

Make sure you can install the following pip packages: `ecdsa`, `fastecdsa`, `sympy` (using `pip3 install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy`). On Ubuntu, for example, you will have to first run:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
----

On Mac, you can use `brew`:

[source,bash]
----
brew install gmp
----

Install the `cairo-lang` Python package using:

[source,bash]
----
pip3 install cairo-lang
----

Alternatively, you can download the package (`cairo-lang-0.10.3.zip`) from https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/tag/v0.10.3, and install it using:

[source,bash]
----
pip3 install cairo-lang-0.10.3.zip
----

Cairo was tested with python3.9. To make it work with python3.6, you will have to install `contextvars`:

[source,bash]
----
pip3 install contextvars
----


[id="compiling-and-running-a-cairo-program"]
== Compiling and running a Cairo program
1 - Create a file, named `test.cairo`, with the following lines:

[source,cairo]
----
func main() {
[ap] = 1000, ap++;
    [ap] = 2000, ap++;
[ap] = [ap - 2] + [ap - 1], ap++;
ret;
}
----

2 - Compile: (make sure all commands are executed in the virtual environment)

[source,bash]
----
cairo-compile test.cairo --output test_compiled.json
----

3 - Run:

[source,bash]
----
cairo-run \
--program=test_compiled.json --print_output \
--print_info --relocate_prints
----

4 - You can open the Cairo tracer by providing the `--tracer` flag to `cairo-run`. Then open it at
http://localhost:8100/.


[id="visual-studio-code-setup"]
== Visual Studio Code setup
Download the Cairo Visual Studio Code extension (`cairo-0.10.3.vsix`) from https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/tag/v0.10.3, and install it using:

[source,bash]
----
code --install-extension cairo-0.10.3.vsix
----

Configure Visual Studio Code settings:
[source,bash]
----
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"editor.formatOnSaveTimeout": 1500
----

[NOTE]
====
You should start Visual Studio Code from the terminal running the virtual environment, by typing
code. For instructions for macOS, see https://code.visualstudio0.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line[here].
