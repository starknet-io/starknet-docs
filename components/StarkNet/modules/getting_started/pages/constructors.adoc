[#constructors]
= Constructors

A contract may need to initialize its state before it is ready for public use. For example,
one may want to designate a contract owner, that can do certain operations that other users canâ€™t.
Setting a storage variable to the owner can be done by the contract constructor. The contract
constructor is defined using the `@constructor` decorator and its name must be `constructor`.
The constructor semantics are similar to that of any other external function, except that the
constructor is guaranteed to run during the contract deployment and it cannot be invoked again after
the contract is deployed.

For example, we can define an ownable contract as follows:

[#ownable]
[source,cairo]
----
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin

// Define a storage variable for the owner address.
@storage_var
func owner() -> (owner_address: felt) {
}

@constructor
func constructor{
    syscall_ptr: felt*,
    pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*,
    range_check_ptr,
}(owner_address: felt) {
    owner.write(value=owner_address);
    return ();
}

@view
func get_owner{
    syscall_ptr: felt*,
    pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*,
    range_check_ptr,
}() -> (address: felt) {
    let (address) = owner.read();
    return (address=address);
}
----

Save the contract as `ownable.cairo` and then compile and declare it.

[#ownable_compile_and_declare]
[source,bash]
----
starknet-compile ownable.cairo \
    --output ownable_compiled.json \
    --abi ownable_abi.json
starknet declare --contract ownable_compiled.json
----

After compiling the contract, you can deploy it. When you deploy the contract, replace
`$\{OWNABLE_CLASS_HASH\}` with the class hash you got from `starknet declare`, and pass the arguments
using the `--inputs` flag. The number of inputs must match the signature of the constructor, or the
deploy transaction will fail.

[#ownable_deploy]
[source,bash]
----
starknet deploy --class_hash ${OWNABLE_CLASS_HASH} --inputs 123
----

When a contract is deployed, the contract address, contract class hash and the constructor calldata
are included in the on-chain data.
