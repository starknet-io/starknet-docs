= Writing Starknet contracts

In order to follow this tutorial you should have basic familiarity with
writing Cairo code. For example, you can read the first few pages of the
link:https://starknet.io/docs/hello_cairo/index.html#hello-cairo[Hello,
Cairo] tutorial. You should also
xref:setting_up_the_environment.adoc[set up your
environment] and make sure your installed Cairo version is at least
`0.10.0` (you can check your version by running
`cairo-compile --version`).

[id="your-first-contract"]
== Your first contract

Let’s start by looking at the following Starknet contract:

[#first_starknet_contract]
[source,cairo]
----
// Declare this file as a Starknet contract.
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin

// Define a storage variable.
@storage_var
func balance() -> (res: felt) {
}

// Increases the balance by the given amount.
@external
func increase_balance{
    syscall_ptr: felt*,
    pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*,
    range_check_ptr,
}(amount: felt) {
    let (res) = balance.read();
    balance.write(res + amount);
    return ();
}

// Returns the current balance.
@view
func get_balance{
    syscall_ptr: felt*,
    pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*,
    range_check_ptr,
}() -> (res: felt) {
    let (res) = balance.read();
    return (res=res);
}
----

The first line, `%lang starknet` declares that this file should be
read as a Starknet contract file, rather than a regular Cairo program
file. Trying to compile this file with `cairo-compile` will result in
a compilation error. Compiling Starknet contracts should be done with
the `starknet-compile` command as we shall see below.

Next, we have an import statement. If you’re not familiar with this type
of statement, refer to the
link:https://starknet.io/docs/hello_cairo/index.html#hello-cairo[Hello,
Cairo] tutorial. Note that you don’t need to explicitly use the
`%builtins` directive in Starknet contracts.

The first new primitive that we see in the code is `@storage_var`.
Unlike a Cairo program, which is stateless, Starknet contracts have a
state, called “the contract’s storage”. Transactions invoked on such
contracts may modify this state, in a way defined by the contract.

[#storage-var]
The `@storage_var` decorator declares a variable which will be kept as
part of this storage. In our case, this variable consists of a single
`felt`, called `balance`. To use this variable, we will use the
`balance.read()` and `balance.write()` functions which are
automatically created by the `@storage_var` decorator. When a contract
is deployed, all its storage cells are initialized to zero. In
particular, all storage variables are initially zero.

Starknet contracts have no `main()` function. Instead, each function
may be annotated as an external function (using the `@external`
decorator). External functions may be called by the users of Starknet,
and by other contracts (see
xref:calling_contracts.adoc[Calling another contract]).

In our case, the contract has two external functions:
`increase_balance` reads the current value of balance from the
storage, adds the given amount to it and writes the new value back to
storage. `get_balance` simply reads the balance and returns its value.

[#view-decorator]
The `@view` decorator is identical to the `@external` decorator. The
only difference is that the method is _annotated_ as a method that only
queries the state rather than modifying it. Note that in the current
version this is not enforced by the compiler.

Consider the three implicit arguments: `syscall_ptr`, `pedersen_ptr`
and `range_check_ptr`:

. You should be familiar with `pedersen_ptr`, which allows to compute
the Pedersen hash function, and `range_check_ptr`, which allows to
compare integers. But it seems that the contract doesn’t use any hash
function or integer comparison, so why are they needed? The reason is
that storage variables require these implicit arguments in order to
compute the actual memory address of this variable. This may not be
needed in simple variables such as `balance`, but with maps (see
xref:user_auth.adoc#storage-maps[Storage maps])
computing the Pedersen hash is part of what `read()` and `write()`
do.
. `syscall_ptr` is a new primitive, unique to Starknet contracts (it
doesn’t exist in Cairo). `syscall_ptr` allows the code to invoke
system calls. It is also an implicit argument of `read()` and
`write()` (required, in this case, because storage access is done
using system calls).

=== Programming without hints

If you are familiar with programming in Cairo, you are probably familiar
with link:https://starknet.io/docs/how_cairo_works/hints.html#hints[hints].
Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your personal opinion),
using hints in Starknet is not possible. This is due to the fact that
the contract’s author, the user invoking the function and the operator
running it are likely to be different entities:

. The operator cannot run arbitrary Python code due to security
concerns.
. The user won’t be able to verify that the operator ran the hint the
contract author supplied.
. It is not possible to prove that nondeterministic code _failed_, since
you should either prove you executed the hint or prove that for any hint
the code would’ve failed.

For efficiency, hints are still used by the standard library functions,
through a mechanism of whitelisting (a function is whitelisted by an
operator if it agrees to run it, when it knows that it can run its hints
successfully. It doesn’t have to do with the question of the soundness
of the library function, which should be verified separately). This
means that not all the Cairo library functions can be used when writing
a Starknet contract. See
https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/security/starknet_common.cairo[here]
for a list of the whitelisted library functions.

[id="compile-the-contract"]
== Compile the contract

Create a file named `contract.cairo` and copy the contract code into
it.

Run the following command to compile your contract:

[#compile_starknet]
[source,bash]
----
starknet-compile contract.cairo \
    --output contract_compiled.json \
    --abi contract_abi.json
----

As mentioned above, we can’t compile Starknet contract using
`cairo-compile` and we need to use `starknet-compile` instead.

[id="the-contract-s-abi"]
== The contract’s ABI

Let’s examine the file `contract_abi.json` that was created during the
contract’s compilation:

[#starknet_abi]
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "inputs": [
            {
                "name": "amount",
                "type": "felt"
            }
        ],
        "name": "increase_balance",
        "outputs": [],
        "type": "function"
    },
    {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "get_balance",
        "outputs": [
            {
                "name": "res",
                "type": "felt"
            }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
    }
]
----

The ABI file contains a list of all the callable functions and their
expected inputs.

[#declare-the-contract-on-the-starknet-testnet]
[id="declare-the-contract-on-the-starknet-testnet"]
== Declare the contract on the Starknet testnet

In order to instruct the CLI to work with the Starknet testnet you
should either pass `--network=alpha-goerli` on every use, or set the
`STARKNET_NETWORK` environment variable as follows:

[#starknet_env]
[source,bash]
----
export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
----

Unlike Ethereum, Starknet distinguishes between a contract class and a
contract instance. A contract class represents the code of a contract
(but with no state), while a contract instance represents a specific
instance of the class, with its own state.

Run the following command to declare your contract class on the Starknet
testnet:

[#starknet_declare]
[source,bash]
----
starknet declare --contract contract_compiled.json
----

The output should look like:

[#starknet_declare_output]
[source,bash]
----
Declare transaction was sent.
Contract class hash: 0x1e2208b571b2cb68908f37a196ed5e391c8933a6db23bb3939acedee40d9b8a
Transaction hash: 0x762e166dd3326b2e263eb5bcfdccd225dc88e067fdf7c92cf8ce5e4ea01f9f1
----

You can see here the class hash of your new contract. You’ll need this
class hash in order to deploy an instance of the contract using the
xref:deploying_from_contracts.adoc[deploy
system call].

[#deploy-the-contract-on-the-starknet-testnet]
== Deploy the contract on the Starknet testnet

[IMPORTANT]
====
The alpha release is an experimental release. Newer
versions may require a reset of the network’s state (resulting in the
removal of the deployed contracts).
====

Run the following command to deploy your contract on the Starknet
testnet (replace `$CLASS_HASH` with the class hash you got from
`starknet declare`):

[#starknet_deploy]
[source,bash]
----
starknet deploy --class_hash $CLASS_HASH
----

The output should look like:

[#starknet_deploy_output]
[source,bash]
----
Invoke transaction for contract deployment was sent.
Contract address: 0x039564c4f6d9f45a963a6dc8cf32737f0d51a08e446304626173fd838bd70e1c
Transaction hash: 0x125e4bc5251af8ee2664ea0d1495b36c593f25f78f1a78f637a3f7aafa9e22
----

You can see here the address of your new contract. You’ll need this
address to interact with the contract.

Set the following environment variable:

[#intro_contract_address]
[source,bash]
----
# The deployment address of the previous contract.
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS="<address of the previous contract>"
----

[#interact-with-the-contract]
== Interact with the contract

Run the following command to invoke the `increase_balance()`:

[#starknet_invoke]
[source,bash]
----
starknet invoke \
    --address ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS} \
    --abi contract_abi.json \
    --function increase_balance \
    --inputs 1234
----

The result should look like:

[#starknet_invoke_output]
[source,bash]
----
Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x039564c4f6d9f45a963a6dc8cf32737f0d51a08e446304626173fd838bd70e1c
Transaction hash: 0x69d743891f69d758928e163eff1e3d7256752f549f134974d4aa8d26d5d7da8
----

[NOTE]
====
Due to the use of fees in Starknet, every interaction with a
contract through a function invocation must be done using an account. To
set up an account, see
xref:account_setup.adoc[Setting up a
Starknet account].
====

The following command allows you to query the transaction status based
on the transaction hash that you got (here you’ll have to replace
`TRANSACTION_HASH` with the transaction hash printed by
`starknet invoke`):

[#tx-status]
[#starknet_tx_status]
[source,bash]
----
starknet tx_status --hash TRANSACTION_HASH
----

The result should look like:

[#starknet_tx_status_output]
[source,json]
----
{
    "block_hash": "0x0",
    "tx_status": "ACCEPTED_ON_L2"
}
----

The possible statuses are:

* `NOT_RECEIVED`: The transaction has not been received yet (i.e., not
written to storage).
* `RECEIVED`: The transaction was received by the sequencer.
* `PENDING`: The transaction passed the validation and entered the
pending block.
* `REJECTED`: The transaction failed validation and thus was skipped.
* `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`: The transaction passed the validation and entered
an actual created block.
* `ACCEPTED_ON_L1`: The transaction was accepted on-chain.

[#query-the-balance]
== Query the balance

Use the following command to query the current balance:
[#starknet_call]
[source,bash]
----
starknet call \
    --address ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS} \
    --abi contract_abi.json \
    --function get_balance
----

The result should be:

[#starknet_call_output]
[source,bash]
----
1234
----

[NOTE]
====
To see the up-to-date balance you should wait until the
`increase_balance` transaction status is at least `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`
(that is, `ACCEPTED_ON_L2` or `ACCEPTED_ON_L1`). Otherwise, you’ll
see the balance before the execution of the `increase_balance`
transaction (that is, 0).
====

In the next section we will describe other CLI functions for querying
Starknet’s state. Note that while `deploy` and `invoke` affect
Starknet’s state, all other functions are read-only. In particular,
using `call` instead of `invoke` on a function that may change the
state, such as `increase_balance`, will return the result of the
function without actually applying it to the current state, allowing the
user to dry-run before committing to a state update.
