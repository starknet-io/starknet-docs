= Deploying Starknet contracts

== Overview

In this section, you will learn to compile, deploy and interact with a Starknet contract written in Cairo.

== Setting up environment variables 

Bash environment variables are used to store configuration information, set system-wide settings, and provide information to scripts.

The following commands must run every time you open a new terminal in order to interact with
Starknet. Setting them saves you time when using the CLI within the same terminal session.

[,Bash]
----
export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
export CAIRO_COMPILER_DIR=~/.cairo/target/release/
export CAIRO_COMPILER_ARGS=--add-pythonic-hints
----

== Setting up an account 

In order to deploy a smart contract to Starknet, you need to set up an account contract and fund it.

[NOTE]
====
Starknet accounts are smart contracts. As such, creating one involves sending a transaction, and takes longer than creating an EOA on other networks.

You can learn more in the https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/introduction/[accounts] section of the documentation.
====

Setting up a Starknet account will involve three steps:

* Generating your account address locally
* Funding it
* Deploying it

Starknet accounts declared through the CLI are stored on your machine in folder `~/.starknet_accounts/`.

Create a new account using the following command:

[,Bash]
----
starknet new_account --account account_name
----

Your terminal will return your account's address. 
[,Bash]
----
Account address: 0x00d9d851f600d539a9f7811de4d9613a6b3c2634f8c0386a305c03216bd67559
Public key: 0x0293d6625d860b9a37a0319d1e3c1eecc27685075cbeaae4ef29ed717d93c58b
Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account
by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command.

NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed
differently.
----

Next we will fund the account with some L2 Goerli ETH. Use the https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io[faucet] to obtain funds and send them to the newly created account.

[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to use an Ethereum Goerli (L1) faucet then bridge your testnet ETH to Starknet
using the link:https://goerli.starkgate.starknet.io/[Goerli Starkgate bridge].
====

Ensure that the funding transaction reaches the `PENDING` status before moving on. You can find
it by going to https://testnet.starkscan.co/[Starkscan] or https://goerli.voyager.online/[Voyager].

Once the transaction is confirmed, you can deploy the account using the following command:

[,Bash]
----

starknet deploy_account --account account_name
----

The output should look similar to the below code snippet:

[,Bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000568 ETH (568383605914463 WEI).
Sent deploy account contract transaction.
Contract address: 0x03f42fc2355be54197a8b270ff2cb8e2eb7902e777b3498f8ad58c6c147cce60
Transaction hash: 0x3d15e05389ecd1ff65555220be57f0ab43729877b20ca086048276917ed2838
----

Use the generated transaction hash to monitor the deploy account transaction until it shows the
`PENDING` status.

== Create and compile a contract

Now you have an account and have funded it will Goerli ETH.

Ensure that the below commands are working properly on your system. If
they don't, make sure you have followed the steps in the xref:cairo_1/environment_setup.adoc[Setting up your environment]
section.

[,Bash]
----
starknet --version
starknet-compile --version
----

Create a folder to store your smart contract. Inside the new folder, create a file name
`hello_starknet.cairo`.

[,Bash]
----
mkdir example && cd example
touch hello_starknet.cairo
----

Copy and paste the following piece of code into your `hello_starknet.cairo` file:

[,Bash]
----
#[contract]
mod HelloStarknet {
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    #[event]
    fn Hello(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {}

    #[event]
    fn Getting_Started(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {}


    #[external]
    fn say_hello(message:felt252) {
        let caller=get_caller_address();
        Hello(caller, message);
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
For a more detailed explanation of the above code, see the xref:cairo_1/writing_a_starknet_contract.adoc[Writing a smart contract section].
====

Now, compile the above Starknet contract using the following command:

[,Bash]
----
starknet-compile hello_starknet.cairo simplestorage.json
----

The above command should compile to produce a `â‰ˆ` file  in the same folder.

We have now created a contracts and compiled it. Next, we will deploy it to Starknet.

== Declare a contract class 

On Starknet, the deployment process is in two steps:

* Declaring the class of your contract (sending your contract's code to the network)
* Deploying a contract (creating an instance of the code you previously declared)

Complete the following steps to declare your contract class of the above contract example:

[,Bash]
----
starknet declare --contract hello_starknet.cairo --account account_name
----
____
The above command may fail if you are using code that has already been declared by someone else! Please make sure to add custom code to your contract to create a new contract class.
____

You will see something like:

[,Bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000132 ETH (131904173791637 WEI).
Declare transaction was sent.
Contract class hash: 0x8ceb9796d2809438d1e992b8ac17cfe83d0cf5944dbad948a370e0b5d5924f
Transaction hash: 0x334f16d9da30913c4a30194057793379079f35efa6bf5753bc6e724a591e9f0
----
The transaction hash allows you to track when the network will have received your contract's code. Once this transaction has moved to "PENDING", you can deploy an instance of your contract.

== Deploy a contract

Using the above generated class hash, deploy the contract:

[,Bash]
----
starknet deploy --class_hash 0x8ceb9796d2809438d1e992b8ac17cfe83d0cf5944dbad948a370e0b5d5924f --account account_name
----

____
If you run into any fee related issues, please add the flag  `--max_fee 100000000000000000` to your CLI commands to set an arbitrary high gas limit for your deploy transaction.
____

You will see something like:

[,Bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000197 ETH (197273405375932 WEI).
Invoke transaction for contract deployment was sent.
Contract address: 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d
Transaction hash: 0x7895267b3e967e1c9c2f7da145e323bed60dfdd1b8ecc8efd243c9d587d579a
----

Monitor the deploy transaction. Once it has passed "PENDING", your contract has been successfully
deployed!

== Interact with your contract

If you quickly browse through the above contract (`hello_starknet.cairo`), you can see the
contract has a simple function: `say_hello` which we are going to learn to trigger.

[,Bash]
----

#Function that we will be invoking
#[external]
fn say_hello(message:felt252) {
    let caller=get_caller_address();
    Hello(caller, message);
}
----

The syntax to invoke a function in your contract is:

[,Bash]
----
starknet invoke --function <name of the function> --address <address of the deployed contract> --account <account_name>

# Invoking our say_hello function
starknet invoke --function say_hello --address 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d --input 152  --account account_name
----

You will see something like:

[,Bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000080 ETH (79590795788372 WEI).
Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d
Transaction hash: 0xbfb3ec183b4ee58db67113cf8832c31e78fe8000f091cc598d5aa9ca6a62af
