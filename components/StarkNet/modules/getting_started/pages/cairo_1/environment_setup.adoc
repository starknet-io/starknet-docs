= Setting up your local development environment

This section will cover three steps: 

* Installing prerequisites
* Installing the `cairo-lang` CLI
* Installing the `cairo` Cairo 1 compiler

== Prerequisites

In order to install and use `cairo` and `cairo-lang`, install the following: +

* https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/[Python 3.9] +
* https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[Rust] +

== cairo-lang CLI Installation

=== Step 1: Set up your virtual environment

We recommend working inside a Python virtual environment, but you can also install the `cairo`
package directly. To create and enter the virtual environment, type:

[,Bash]
----
#Activate your cairo virtual environment
python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
----

Alternatively, you can also use the `pyenv` environment manager to create a virtual environment. To do so, run the following commands:

[,Bash]
----
#Install pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

#Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

#Restart your terminal and run the following commands
pyenv install 3.9.0
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 cairo_venv
pyenv activate cairo_venv
----

Either way, make sure the `venv` is activated â€“ you should see (`cairo_venv`) in the command line prompt.

Your terminal should look like this:

[,Bash]
----
(cairo_venv) satoshi@nakamoto-notebook % 

----

=== Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies

On Ubuntu, for example, you will have to first run:

[,Bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
----

On Mac, you can use brew:

[,Bash]
----
brew install gmp
----

Finally, install the following dependencies:

[,Bash]
----
(cairo_venv) satoshi@nakamoto-notebook % pip install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
----

There might be some other libraries which are not direct dependencies, but they might be indirect
dependencies that you would need to install based on your operating system.

=== Step 3: Install cairo-lang CLI

If you had `cairo-lang` installed previously, uninstall it and install the latest version.

[,Bash]
----
#Uninstall the previous version
pip uninstall cairo-lang
#Install locally
pip install cairo-lang

#Alternatively, you can download the latest zip of cairo-lang and install it
pip install $HOME/Downloads/cairo-lang-0.11.0.2.zip
----

Once you have installed the cairo lang package, make sure to test your installation by running the following command:

[,Bash]
----
(cairo_venv) satoshi@nakamoto-notebook % starknet --version      
starknet 0.11.0.2

----

Please check that the version returned matches.

NOTE: For M1 and M2 users, if you face any issues while running starknet --version command, 
then you may refer to https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22[this] article to follow alternate steps to install the dependencies in Step 2.

== `cairo` Cairo 1 compiler Installation

=== Step1: Clone the cairo repository and set it up using the following instructions:

[,Bash]
----
# Go to your $HOME directory
cd ~/
# Clone the `cairo` Cairo 1 compiler to a folder called .cairo in your home directory
git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/ .cairo

#Checkout into the working branch and generate the release binaries
cd .cairo/
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-alpha.6
cargo build --all --release

----

=== Step 2: Add Cairo 1.0 executables to your path:

Now that we have built the Cairo 1.0 binaries, we need to add them to the `PATH` environment variable. Add the following in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

[,Bash]
----
#Add the below command to your .bashrc or .zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.cairo/target/release:$PATH"
----

After that, open a new shell and check that the following command returns a version number:

[,Bash]
----
cairo-compile --version
----

Your output should look something like this(not necessarily inside the `cairo_venv`):

[,Bash]
----
(cairo_venv) satoshi@nakamoto-notebook % cairo-lang-compiler 1.0.0-alpha.6
----

Woohoo! Now we have everything we need to compile, deploy and interact with our first Cairo contract!
