= Writing your first Starknet contract

In this section, you will learn to write your first Starknet contract. We know you are super

excited and so are we!

This contract is a simple read/write contract where you will learn to read
and write from storage using Cairo. Our contract will be called `SimpleStorage`.

Follow the below steps to learn to write your first Starknet contract.

== Step 1: Contract [#macro] and modules

You can create a new folder to write this new contract or create it inside your `.cairo/` folder.
Let us create a new file called `simple_storage.cairo`.

[,Bash]
----
touch simple_storage.cairo
----

You can open this empty file in your editor of choice (eg: VS Code) and start writing the below
lines of code - your first Cairo contract.

A Starknet contract will always start with the `[#contract]` macro to indicate that this is a Starknet contract. Remember that you can also create other Cairo files that are *NOT* contracts because Cairo is a programming language by itself.

All the Cairo contracts are defined by the keyword `mod` which implies that it's a module containing some logical piece of code.
You can write first below lines of contract in the `simple_storage.cairo` file.

[,Bash]
----
#[contract]
mod SimpleStorage {}
----

== Step 2: Creating the Storage

In order to store variables on-chain, we need to create a storage structure called `Storage`.
This struct will have all the variables that you would like to have in contract/permanent storage.

Create a Storage struct within your `SimpleStorage` contract as shown below.

[,Bash]
----
struct Storage {
       balance: felt252
}
----

____

NOTE: The storage struct will always be named `Storage`.
____

== Step 3: Defining events

Yes! You read it right. Events are now supported in Cairo. You can define an event just like a function with the name of the event, in this case it is `BalanceIncreased` and the values you would like to emit within the bracket as arguments.

[,Bash]
----
//The keyword to define a function is "fn"
 #[event]
 fn BalanceIncreased(balance: felt252) {}
----

== Step 4: Writing your first function

Below is a simple function called `increase_balance` which takes in the amount as the argument of type `felt252`.
The function is fairly simple. We read the balance variable(defined earlier in the storage struct) using `::read()` function and simple increase the balance by adding the amount to it.

We then write the new balance to the existing storage variable and update the value.

Last but not the least, we log/emit the event with the updated balance using the name of the event function.

[,Bash]
----
  #[external]
  fn increase_balance(amount: felt252) {
      let new_balance = balance::read() + amount;
      balance::write(new_balance);
      BalanceIncreased(new_balance);
  }
----

You might have noticed a macro called `external` that is added to this function. This means that the function called be called externally or outside of the contract.

For functions that are modifying a storage variable, you would need to add the external macro.

There are other types of macros as well that you can add to a function: +
* event +
* external +
* view +
* constructor +

Let us see another function in the next step and the macro used.

== Step 5: Writing your view function

As you saw in Step 4, we are able to write to our storage using `balance::write()`, but how do we read from the storage? (Hint: That's also being done in the above function).

In the below function, we are reading the current balance of the storage variable _balance_ and returning it. You can observe that we use a `->` symbol to return the variable, similar to Rust.

This function can be a `view` function because it does not modify any variables.

[,Bash]
----
  #[view]
  fn get_balance() -> felt252 {
       balance::read()
  }
----

== Step 6: Putting it all together

Your final contract should look something like this.

[,Bash]
----
#[contract]
mod SimpleStorage {
   struct Storage {
       balance: felt252
   }

   #[event]
   fn BalanceIncreased(balance: felt252) {}

   #[external]
   fn increase_balance(amount: felt252) {
      let new_balance = balance::read() + amount;
      balance::write(new_balance);
      BalanceIncreased(new_balance);
   }

   #[view]
   fn get_balance() -> felt252 {
       balance::read()
   }
}
----

You can now follow the steps given in the xref:documentation:getting_started:deploying_contracts.adoc[Deploying smart contracts] section to compile and deploy the
above contract.

Congratulations on successfully writing and deploying your first Cairo contract!

== Quick Challenge

Once you have deployed the above contract, you would need to invoke the contract and also `call`
the `get_balance` function. The _call_ syntax has not been mentioned in the previous section but
it's fairly easy to use and that's your +++<strong>+++challenge+++<strong>+++!

If you have successfully been able to call the function and display the balance, take a
screenshot and post it on Twitter, tagging us at link:https://twitter.com/Starknet[@StarkNet].
