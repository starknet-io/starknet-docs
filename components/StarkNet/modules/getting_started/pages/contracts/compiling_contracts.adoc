== Compile the contract

ðŸš§

Take the file named `simple_storage.cairo` that you created in the
xref:writing_starknet_contracts.adoc[Writing Starknet contracts] section and run the following
command to compile your contract:

[#compile_starknet]
[source,bash]
----
starknet-compile contract.cairo \
    --output contract_compiled.json \
    --abi contract_abi.json
----

As mentioned above, we canâ€™t compile Starknet contract using
`cairo-compile` and we need to use `starknet-compile` instead.
