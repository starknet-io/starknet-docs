== Compile the contract

Create a file named `contract.cairo` and copy the contract code into
it.

Run the following command to compile your contract:

[#compile_starknet]
[source,bash]
----
starknet-compile contract.cairo \
    --output contract_compiled.json \
    --abi contract_abi.json
----

As mentioned above, we canâ€™t compile Starknet contract using
`cairo-compile` and we need to use `starknet-compile` instead.
