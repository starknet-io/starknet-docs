= Simplified transaction flow

The key stages of transaction lifetime are:

.   A new transaction is sent to the mempool with a nonce
.   The sequencer selects a valid transaction from the mempool
.   If the transaction is valid, the `execute` function is called
.   If `execute` is successful, the sequencer passes the transaction to the StarkNet prover
