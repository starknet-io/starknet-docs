= Simplified transaction flow

The key stages of transaction lifetime are:

.   The sequencer selects a valid transaction from the mempool and executes `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate&lowbar;&lowbar;`
.   If the transaction is valid, the _execute_ function is called
.   If _execute_ was successful, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block, charges the fee and proceeds to work on the next transaction (once the block is concluded, it will be sent to the prover)

The sequencer receives fees in ETH in return for including transactions in a block.
