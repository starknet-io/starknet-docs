= Deploying new accounts

Since xref:documentation:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet version 0.10.1] the historical method of deploying accounts on StarkNet, the `deploy` transaction, has been removed.

It has now been replaced with the `deploy_account` transaction which allows you to deploy an account and pay fees from a pre-funded address (thus solving the issue of how to pay fees while not yet having a deployed account).

## Deploy account transaction

In order to deploy a new account on StarkNet you need to complete the following steps:

* Decide on the account contract that you want to deploy
* Compute your would-be account address off-chain
* Send funds to this address

Once the address has enough funds to pay for the deployment, you can then send a `deploy_account` transaction.

## Transaction flow

Upon receiving a `deploy_account` transaction, the sequencer will:

* Verify that the address has funds to pay for the deployment
* Execute the constructor with the given arguments
* Execute the `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy&lowbar;&lowbar;` entry point (See below)
* Charge fee from the new account address
* Advance the nonce to 1

## Validate deploy

There are two potential issues that arise from sending a `deploy_account` transaction without any extra validation:

* Sequencers having the ability to charge arbitrarily high fees, thus potentially draining user funds from a pre-funded account
* A bad actor having the ability to carry out a sequencer DOS attack by sending multiple, invalid `deploy_account` transactions. This would result in the sequencer not being compensated for work completed.


To prevent the scenario described in the first point, a new optional validation entrypoint is provided: `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy&lowbar;&lowbar;`.

To prevent the potential DOS attack from the second point, we introduce some limitations on the constructor and __validate_deploy_
_ executions, namely:

* Limited # of Cairo steps
* Limited # of builtin applications
* No external contract calls (library calls and self-calls are allowed)

This entrypoint should be included in any accounts or contracts that wish to allow this new deployment flow.

### Using validate deploy

`&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy&lowbar;&lowbar;` expects the following arguments:

* class hash
* contract address salt
* constructor arguments - the arguments expected by the contractâ€™s constructor (this will be enforced in the compiler).

[NOTE]
====
In determining the contract address, deployer address 0 will be used.
====

Consider an account with the following constructor signature:

[#constructor_signature]
[source,cairo]
----
@constructor
func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    _public_key: felt
)
----

Then the signature of `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy`&lowbar;&lowbar; must be:

[#call_validate_deploy]
[source,cairo]
----
func __validate_deploy__{
    syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr, ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin*
}(class_hash: felt, contract_address_salt: felt, _public_key: felt)
----

[NOTE]
====
The transaction hash and `max_fee` are accessible through the `get_tx_info` system call.
