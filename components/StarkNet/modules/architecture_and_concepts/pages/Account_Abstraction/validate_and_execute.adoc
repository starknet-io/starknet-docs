[id="validate_and_execute"]
= `validate` and `execute`

StarkNet's account smart contract includes the following two functions, which account transactions call: 

* `validate`
* `execute`

Separating the `validate` and `execute` functions guarantees payment to sequencers for work completed, and protects them from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

[id="the_validate_function"]
== The `validate` function

The `validate` function:

*   Ensures that any transaction submitted is genuine and therefore will not take up unjustified resources during the execution process.

Without this mechanism, a forged transaction can result in the sequencer taking a fee and charging you unfairly.
In short, `validate` ensures that the sequencer can only charge for valid transactions.

* Enables the sequencer to quickly and efficiently select valid transactions from the Starknet mempool, ensuring that sequencers can charge more accurately than in a system where `validate` and `execute` functions are bound together.

[id="invalid_transactions"]
== Invalid transactions

When the `validate` function returns invalid, no fee will be taken from the account in question.

[id="the_execute_function"]
== The `execute` function

The purpose of the `execute` function is to abstract away the remaining actions performed by a transaction. This is the step where the sequencer will process transactions that are to be included in a block. 

[id="reverted_transactions"]
== Reverted transactions

The `execute` function reverts the transaction when the method fails for any reason. 

The sequencer charges only for successful transactions that result from the successful completion of the `execute` function.
