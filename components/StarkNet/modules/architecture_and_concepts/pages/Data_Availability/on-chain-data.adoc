== Introduction

In the current stage of the Alpha, Starknet operates in a ZK-Rollup mode. This means that upon the acceptance of a state update on-chain, the state diff between the previous and new state is sent as calldata to Ethereum.

This data allows anyone that observes Ethereum to reconstruct the current state of Starknet.


[NOTE]
====
To update the Starknet state on L1, it suffices to send a valid proof -- without information
on the transactions or particular changes that this update caused.

Consequently, more information must be provided in order to allow other parties to locally track Starknet's state.

== On-chain data: pre v0.11.0

[id="pre_v0.11.0_format"]
=== Pre v0.11.0 Format

The state diffs contain information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments. Those differences are sent as `uint256[]` array as part of the calldata, and are encoded as follows:

* Number of cells that encode contract deployments
* For each deployed contract, we have:
 ** `contract_address` - the xref:../Contracts/contract-address.adoc[address] of the deployed contract
 ** `contract_hash` - the xref:../Contracts/class-hash.adoc[hash] of the class
* Number of contracts whose storage is updated
* For each such contract, we have:
 ** `contract_address` - the xref:../Contracts/contract-address.adoc[address] of the contract
 ** `num_of_storage_updates` - number of storage updates
 ** `nonce, num_of_storage_updates ` - a uint256 value that encodes both the number of storage updates for that contract and the updated nonce:
+
[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{128 bits}} | \underbrace{\text{new nonce}}_{\text{64 bits}} |
{\underbrace{\text{# of storage updates}}_{\text{64 bits}}}_{\text{LSB}}
++++
 ** For each storage update:
  *** `key` - the address inside the contract's storage where the value is updated
  *** `value` - the new value

** One update (indicated by the cell at index 8):
 **  Following the above contract address, we have `18446744073709551617` (index 8 in the array), which is stem:[$2^{64}+1$], thus:

== On-chain data: post v0.11.0


[id="v0.11.0_format"]
=== v0.11.0 Format

The state diffs contain information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments.

For each affected contract, we have:

* The contract adddress
* A single word that encodes:

** class information flag (0 = Storage updates only / 1 = contract was deployed or replaced in
this state update). When this flag is on, we will have an additional word before the storage
updates section, which contains the new class hash
** nonce
** num_of_storage_updates

See below for the expected format:

[stem]
++++
\underbrace{0\cdots0}_{\text{127 bits}}|
\underbrace{\text{class information flag}}_{\text{1 bit}}|
\underbrace{\text{new nonce}}_{\text{64 bits}}|{
\underbrace{\text{# of storage updates}}_{\text{64 bits}}}_{\text{LSB}}
++++

For each storage update:

* key - the address inside the contractâ€™s storage where the value is updated
* value - the new value

Next, we have information about newly declared classes:

* The # of (Cairo 1.0) classes that were declared in the block
* For each class we have:
* The class hash
* xref:starknet_versions:upcoming_versions.adoc[The compiled class hash]

== Extract from Ethereum

The data described above is sent across several Ethereum transactions, each holding a part of this array as calldata. Each new Starknet block has its associated state diff transactions.

You can find the code for extracting this data from Ethereum in https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/2fe6f549a0b8b9923ed7a21cd1a588bc571657d6/crates/pathfinder/src/ethereum/state_update/retrieve.rs[Pathfinder's repo]. Pathfinder is the first Starknet full node implementation. You may also take a look at the https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/2fe6f549a0b8b9923ed7a21cd1a588bc571657d6/crates/pathfinder/resources/fact_retrieval.py[python script] which extracts the same information.
