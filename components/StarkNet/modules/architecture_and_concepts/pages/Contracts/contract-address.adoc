[id="contract_address"]
= Contract Address

The contract address is a unique identifier of the contract on Starknet. It is a chain hash of the following information:

* `prefix` - the ASCII encoding of the constant string "`STARKNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`"
* `caller_address` - currently always zero
* `salt` - part of the xref:../Blocks/transactions.adoc#deploy-transaction[deploy transaction]
* `contract_hash` - see xref:./contract-hash.adoc[the docs]
* `calldata_hash` - xref:../Hashing/hash-functions.adoc#array-hashing[array hash] of the inputs to the constructor

The computation is roughly the following:

[source,js]
----
contract_address := pedersen(
    “STARKNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS”,
    caller_address,
    salt,
    pedersen(contract_code),
    pedersen(constructor_calldata))
----

You can find the address computation on our repo https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/ed6cf8d6cec50a6ad95fa36d1eb4a7f48538019e/src/starkware/starknet/services/api/gateway/contract_address.py#L12[here].
