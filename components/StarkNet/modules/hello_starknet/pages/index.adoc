StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup operating as an L2 network over Ethereum, where any dApp can achieve unlimited scale for its computation, without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.

Currently, StarkNet’s first step, StarkNet Alpha, is deployed. This tutorial walks you through writing and deploying a StarkNet contract.
