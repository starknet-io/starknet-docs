= Contract Hash
:stem: latexmath

The contract's hash is a hash of its definition. The elements defining a contract are:

* API version - The version under which the contract was deployed.
* Array of external functions entry points - An entry point is a pair `(selector, offset)`, where offset is the offset of the instruction that should be called inside the contract's bytecode.
+
[NOTE]
====
*Function selector*

The selector is an identifier through which the function is callable in transactions or in other contracts. The selector is the xref:../Hashing/hash-functions.adoc#starknet-keccak[starknet_keccak] hash of the function name, encoded in ASCII.
====
* Array of https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/l1l2.html#receiving-a-message-from-l1[L1 handlers] entry points.
* Array of constructors entry points - Currently, the compiler allows only one constructor.
* Array of used builtin names - An ASCII-encode array, ordered by declaration.
* Keccak - The xref:../Hashing/hash-functions.adoc#starknet-keccak[starknet_keccak], of the contract's program. The contract's program stands for the JSON obtained by executing `starknet-compile` with the `--no_debug_info` flag. To see the exact computation of this field, see https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/7712b21fc3b1cb02321a58d0c0579f5370147a8b/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/contract_hash.py#L116[our repo].
* Bytecode - Represented by an array of field elements.

The contract's hash is the chain hash, that is, the xref:../Hashing/hash-functions.adoc#pedersen-hash[Pedersen hash], of the above, computed as follows:

. Start with stem:[$h(0,api\_version)$].
. For every line in the above, excluding the first, compute stem:[$h(h(previous\_line), new\_line)$], where the hash of an array is defined as xref:../Hashing/hash-functions.adoc#starknet-keccak[starknet_keccak].
. Let stem:[$c$] denote the cumulative hash resulting from applying the above process; the contract's hash is then stem:[$h(c, \textrm{number_of_lines})$], where stem:[$\text{number_of_lines}$] is 7.
