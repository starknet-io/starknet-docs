The following version notes cover the ongoing version changes to Starknet. To get the latest version updates delivered to you, please subscribe to our mailing list https://airtable.com/shrFYJjlo9KCpBFMA[here].

== Starknet Environments

Within Starknet's deployment pipeline there are separate and distinct networks that operate independently of each other for testing before deployment.

For more information see the https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/useful_info/[useful information] section.

[id="version0.11.0"]
== Starknet v0.11.0 (Feb, 23)

Version 0.11.0 is the next major release version for Starknet. For more detailed information regarding this version, see xref:upcoming_versions.adoc[upcoming versions].


[id="version0.10.3"]
== Starknet v0.10.3 (Dec 12, 22)

[NOTE]
====
The `deploy` transaction is no longer supported on this version.
====

=== Technical release notes

Starknet

*   Performance - Separate the state commitment computation from the execution of the transactions
*   Add `starknet-class-hash` command to compute the class hash of a compiled Starknet contract

Cairo:

*   Autoformatter: Automatically break lines inside expressions


[id="version0.10.2"]
== Starknet v0.10.2 (Nov 29, 22)

- This version introduces sequencer parallelization! This is the first step in our roadmap of performance upgrades. Details about the specific mechanism of parallelization and the roadmap in general are described in https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-performance-roadmap-bb7aae14c7de[this medium post]. 

- A new endpoint, `estimate_fee_bulk`, is added to the feeder gateway. This will allow estimating the fee of several transactions at once, where each transaction is executed relative to the resulting state from applying the previous one.

=== Technical release notes

*   Sequencing performance improvements
*   Builtin ratio changes, which affects builtin costs
*   Add `estimate_fee_bulk` API that computes the fee of multiple transactions that will be executed consecutively

As part of this version, we will also increase the finality of transactions in the pending block, by fixing the timestamp at the time of the block creation. This will solve the issue of transactions moving from pending to rejected on account of too old timestamp

[id="version0.10.1"]
== Starknet v0.10.1 (Oct 25, 22)

=== Technical release notes

Starknet:

*   Add `DeployAccount` transaction (which will replace the Deploy transaction for deploying account contracts). To use it, you should first add enough funds to your account address to pay the transaction fee, and then you can invoke DeployAccount
*   Split the `starknet deploy_account` CLI command into `starknet new_account` and `starknet deploy_account`
*   Account contracts that are expected to be deployed this way should implement the`__validate_deploy__()` entry point, which should check the signature of the `DeployAccount` transaction
*   Improve L1 fee computation: the fee is computed according to the diff of the storage state
*   API: Remove `entry_point_type` field from transaction information

Cairo:

*   Add `uint256_mul_div_mod` to `uint256.cairo`


[id="version0.10.0"]
== Starknet v0.10.0 (Sept 05, 22)

This version introduces the next step in Starknet's account abstraction design, specifically the validate/execute separation. See https://www.notion.so/starkware/Starknet-0-10-0-4ac978234c384a30a195ce4070461257[here] for more information.


=== Technical release notes

Starknet:

*   Contract (breaking changes):
**   @external and @view functions should be imported directly by the main compiled file. Otherwise, they will not be usable as external functions
**   Forbid using the same storage variable name in two modules
*   New transaction version (version 1) for `invoke` and `declare` transactions:
**   Transactions of version 0 are deprecated and will not be supported in Starknet from the next version (v0.11.0). Please update your systems to use the new version

[NOTE]
====
In order to use transactions of version 1 you will need to upgrade your account contracts
====

**   Add nonce field to the transactions. Nonce validation is now part of the Starknet protocol and is enforced to be executed sequentially
**   `Invoke`:
***   Split `__execute__` to two functions:` __validate__` (only validates the transaction) and `__execute__` (only executes the transaction)
***   Remove the selector (which is now always `__execute__`) field, following the above change.
**   Declare:
***   `declare` transaction should now be sent from an account (and is validated using `__validate_declare__` in the account contract)
*   Support fee for sending L1 messages. At this point, it's not mandatory and messages with no fee will still be handled. Starting from the next version it will become mandatory.

Cairo:

Syntax changes in Cairo (to make it more similar to rust and C++):

*   You can use the cairo-migrate script to convert old code to the new syntax. Use the `-i` flag to apply the changes to the files
*   End statements with `;`

[NOTE]
====
New lines are still part of the language at this point, and you cannot put more than one instruction per line. This will change in Cairo1.0.
====

*   Use `{ â€¦ }` for code blocks (instead of `:` and `end`)
*   Add `()` around the condition of if statements
*   Remove the member keyword in structs
*   Change comment to use `//` instead of `#`
*   Use `..., ap++` instead of `...; ap++` in low level Cairo code
*   Support return types that are not tuples. For example, `func foo() -> felt` (instead of `func foo() -> (r: felt)`)
As a result, it's now mandatory to specify return types. `func foo() -> (res)` should be replaced by `func foo() -> (res: felt)`. The cairo-migrate tool does that automatically.
*   Return statement accepts expressions, rather than only tuples. For example, you can write `let x = (5,); return x;`
*   A few standard library functions were changed to return felt. The cairo-migrate script also fixes calls to those functions
*   Support using functions as expressions
*   This only applies to functions with -> felt signature`, whose ap change is known at compile-time (e.g., recursive functions cannot be used this way)
*   Fix a bug in the secp signature verification code that allowed a malicious prover to ignore the value of `v` (this does not let the prover fake a signature, but allows it to claim that a valid signature is invalid).
*   Add Cairo code for the recursive STARK verifier

Technical changes:
*   Move from python3.7 to python3.9


[id="version0.9.1"]
== Starknet v0.9.1 (July 20, 22)

=== Technical release notes

Starknet:

API changes:

*   Add `get_block_traces` API - returns all the transaction traces of a given block
*   Add a list of declared contracts in `get_state_update`
*   Add a 0x prefix for class hash in the API
*   Add `starknet_version` field for blocks (only applies to new blocks)

Starknet CLI:

*   Change the default block number to pending
*   Using a wallet is the default, `--no_wallet` must be specified explicitly to override this
*   Deploying contracts:
**  Add `deploy_contract` function to the account contract created by `starknet deploy_account`
**  Use this function to deploy contract (unless using `--no_wallet`). In particular, `deploy` should be used after declaring the contract (it expects the contract class hash)
*   Support `--dry_run` to get the transaction information without signing or sending it
*   Support `deploy_from_zero` in the `deploy` syscall to deploy a contract to an address that does not depend on the deployer

Cairo:
*   Support and in if statements (`if x == y and z == w`). 

[NOTE]
====
At the moment other boolean combinations are not supported
====

[id="version0.9.0"]
== Starknet v0.9.0 (June 06, 22)

This version introduces the contract class/instance paradigm into Starknet. See https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/contract-classes/[here] for more information.

=== Technical release notes

Starknet:

*   Enforce fees - `max_fee` must not be set to zero, and selector must be `__execute__`
*   Split the concepts of contract class and contract instance. 
*   Add `declare` transaction type
*   New API and CLI commands:
*   `declare` - Declares a contract class
*   `get_class_by_hash` - Returns the contract class given its hash
*   `get_class_hash_at` - Returns the class hash for a given contract instance address
*   Rename `delegate_call` to `library_call`, and change the contract address argument to class hash. 
*   Add a `deploy` system call.
*   Rename `ContractDefinition` to `ContractClass`
*   Reduce the compiled contract file's size by removing unnecessary identifiers (this optimization can be disabled using `--dont_filter_identifiers`)

Cairo:

*   Initial support for the `EC-op` builtin (scalar multiplication over the STARK curve). Not supported in Starknet yet.
*   Add additional helper methods to `blake2s.cairo`, including big-endian support

Technical changes:
*   Change function's `return` type from a struct to a named tuple. In particular, `foo.Return.SIZE` is no longer supported.
