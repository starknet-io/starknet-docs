## Block limit (Cairo steps)
The execution of each transaction involves a certain number of computational steps.

Starknet enforces a limit on the number of steps that can be completed
within each block to ensure block production times remain consistent and predictable.

## Block limit (gas)
Certain Starknet operations consume Ethereum gas, e.g L1/L2 messages. The current L1 state update
mechanism involves an Ethereum transaction for each Starknet block.

The gas limit for Starknet blocks is therefore inherited from the gas limit for Ethereum blocks.

[NOTE]
====
The gas limit for Starknet blocks is inherited from the gas limit for Ethereum blocks.

## Mempool size limit

// The mempool contains transactions that have undergone preliminary verification by the sequencer and are candidates for inclusion into a block

The mempool contains transactions that have undergone a preliminary verification by the sequencer
and are candidates for inclusion into a block.

// local to the sequencer (each has a mempool)


## IP address limits (read)
In order to reduce network spam, Starknet limits the amount of contract reads that a single IP
address can make.

## IP address limits (write)
In order to reduce network spam, Starknet limits the amount of contract writes that a single IP
address can make.
