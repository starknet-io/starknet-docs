## Starknet regenesis

image::https://docs.starknet.io/_/img/roadmap.png[]

The next two upgrades happening to Starknet prior to the regenesis event are:

* v0.12.0
* v0.13.0

Until regenesis, old and new contracts will co-exist and will be able to interact with each other. On the regenesis, classes (and contracts that are instances of those classes) written in older Cairo versions will no longer be supported.

## Starknet Alpha v0.12.0

### What to expect
Performance improvements

### Notable changes
* A new sequencer
** Under Apache 2.0 license

* Will include a three fold improvement
** Block execution logic
** Cairo VM in Rust
** State management - Papyrus
