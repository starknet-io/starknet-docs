# Upcoming Starknet versions

## Starknet Alpha v0.12.0

### What to expect
Starknet's upcoming version 0.12.0 focuses on improving network performance, specifically by enhancing the network's throughput.

To achieve this goal, we've introduced a new component in the sequencer called the Blockifier. 
The Blockifier comes with more efficient local storage, and all critical path logic will be
implemented in Rust.

With these changes, we aim to significantly reduce waiting times for transaction confirmations
and solve most of the network congestion cases experienced so far.

### Notable changes
* A new sequencer
** Under Apache 2.0 license

* A threefold improvement:
** Block execution logic
** Cairo VM in Rust
** State management - Papyrus
