# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a Starknet full node giving you a safe view into Starknet.

It provides the following features:

* Access the full Starknet state history
* Verifies state using Ethereum
* Implements the Starknet JSON-RPC API
* Run Starknet functions without requiring a Starknet transaction
* Ability to do fee estimation for transactions

See the official https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder[Pathfinder Github repository] for more details.

## v0.5.4 (latest)

The primary focus of this release is to provide support for Starknet v0.11.1, and will continue to work for v0.11.0. Since this release is required for v0.11.1, you should update your node before the network is updated.

### Added

- Starknet v0.11.1 support
- CORS support via the `rpc.cors-domains` configuration option
- Transaction hashes are now verified as part of the sync process. Previously, these were not verified as the exact algorithm was underdocumented and the transaction format was still evolving.

### Fixed

- RPC server panic for unprefixed unregistered method names
- Data can temporarily appear to go missing when transitioning from `PENDING` to `ACCEPTED ON L2`
  - This was commonly seen when rapidly monitoring a new transaction, which would go from `PENDING` to `TXN_HASH_NOT_FOUND` to `ACCEPTED_ON_L2` as pathfinder moved the ephemeral pending data to latest data on disk.

## v0.5.3

Fixes for minor issues and inconsistencies.

### Added

- `max-rpc-connections` command-line argument. This sets the maximum number incoming RPC connections the pathfinder node will accept. This defaults to 1024 if not specified.
- `cairo-lang` upgraded to 0.11.0.2

### Fixed

- `starknet_simulateTransaction` data model inconsistency
- `poll-pending` default value restored to `false`
- incoming RPC connections limited to 100. This limit was accidentily introduced in v0.5.2 as part of a dependency upgrade, whereas before it was unlimited. The default is now 1024 and can be configured using `--max-rpc-connections`.
- handling of invalid JSON-RPC requests

## v0.5.2

This release fixes a few RPC bugs and adds support for bulk fee estimation and transaction simulation (traces) as part of v0.3 RPC specification.

In addition it also adds a `pathfinder_getTransactionStatus` endpoint which lets you track a transactions status -- including `REJECTED` and `RECEIVED` -- in the same fashion as the gateway.

### Added

- support `starknet_estimateFee` in the JSON-RPC v0.3 API
  - supports estimating multiple transactions
  - this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway)
- support `starknet_simulateTransaction` for JSON-RPC v0.3
  - supports simulating multiple transactions
  - this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway)
- support `pathfinder_getTransactionStatus` which is exposed on all RPC routes
  - this enables querying a transactions current status, including whether the gateway has received or rejected it

### Fixed

- RPC returns int for entrypoint offsets instead of hex
- RPC rejects Fee values with more than 32 digits
- RPC does not expose `pathfinder_getProof` on v0.3 route

## v0.5.1

This is a minor bugfix release, primarily to fix an issue with syncing on `testnet2`.

### Fixed

* pathfinder sometimes spams nethermind L1 nodes
* pathfinder stops syncing `testnet2` at block 95220 due to a Sierra class compilation issue

## v0.5.0

### Highlights

- starknet v0.11.0 support
- RPC API v0.3 partial support
- removed several deprecated config options
- requires python 3.9 or 3.10 (no longer 3.8)

### Added

- support for state commitment and class commitment in `pathfinder_getProof`
- support for starknet v0.11
- partial support for RPC specification v0.3
  - exposed on `/rpc/v0.3/` route
  - missing support for `starknet_estimateFee` and `starknet_simulate`

### Changed

- `starknet_call` and `starknet_estimateFee` JSON-RPC methods return more detailed error messages
- `python` version requirement has changed to `3.9` or `3.10` (was `3.8` or `3.9` previously)

### Fixed

- RPC accepts hex inputs for Felt without '0x' prefix. This led to confusion especially when passing in a decimal string which would get silently interpretted as hex.
- using a Nethermind Ethereum endpoint occasionally causes errors such as `<block-number> could not be found` to be logged.
- sync can miss new block events by getting stuck waiting for pending data.

### Removed

- `--config` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `--integration` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `--sequencer-url` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `--testnet2` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `starknet_addDeployTransaction` as this is no longer an allowed transaction since starknet v0.10.3
- RPC api version `0.1`, which used to be served on path `/rpc/v0.1`

### RPC API

We added support for v0.3 and removed v0.1. We still support v0.2 at both `/rpc/v0.2` and `/rpc` (default) routes. In summary:
```
/                     # serves v0.2
/rpc/v0.2/            # serves v0.2
/rpc/v0.3/            # serves v0.3
```
We are missing `starknet_estimateFee` and `starknet_simulate` support for v0.3, which will be added in an upcoming release.

### Python requirement

Note: this only applies if you are building from source. This does not impact docker users.

Pathfinder requires python to support the starknet VM used to simulate starknet transactions and function calls. Previous versions of the VM only worked with python 3.8 or 3.9 which was a hassle because most operating systems no longer directly support it. The new version of the VM bundled with starknet v0.11 now requires python version 3.9 or 3.10.

### Configuration changes

Several configuration options are now removed, after they were deprecated in pathfinder v0.4.1. Here is a migration guide:

- `--testnet2`: use `--network testnet2` instead
- `--integration`: use `--network integration` instead
- `--sequencer-url`: use `--network custom` in combination with `--feeder-gateway-url` and `gateway-url`
- `--config`: use environment variables or env files as an alternative

## v0.4.5
Hotfix for a bug introduced in the previous version v0.4.4, which prevented a new node from syncing on blocks near genesis.

### Added
Added Newton FAQ links to readme

### Fixed
Node fails to sync old blocks

### New contributors
@SecurityQQ made their first contribution in #799

## v0.4.4
This minor release contains some nice performance improvements for `starknet_call` and `starknet_estimateFee` as well as some minor bug fixes.

Also included is a major new feature: storage proofs - big thanks @pscott for his hard work on this feature! This is available via the `pathfinder_getProof` method which is served from both the pathfinder and Starknet endpoints for convenience:

[source]
<node-url>/rpc/pathfinder/v0.1/pathfinder_getProof
<node-url>/rpc/v0.2/pathfinder_getProof

The method is specified https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/main/pathfinder_rpc_api.json#L22-L113[here].

Its results can be used to formally verify what a contract's storage values are without trusting the pathfinder node.

This is achieved by validating the merkle-proof that pathfinder returns and confirming that it correctly matches the known Starknet state root.

### Added
storage proofs via `pathfinder_getProof` by @pscott

### Fixed
* `starknet_getEvents` returns all events when from_block="latest"
* v0.1 `starknet_getStateUpdate` does not contain nonces

### Changed
* Improved performance for `starknet_call` and `starknet_estimateFee` by caching classes
* Improved performance for `starknet_call` and `starknet_estimateFee` by using Rust for hashing

### New contributors
@pscott made their first contribution in #726


## v0.4.3
The primary purpose of this release is to properly support testnet2 after the xref:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.3[Starknet v0.10.3] update.

The v0.10.3 update changed the testnet2 chain ID which impacts transaction signatures which in turn meant that `starknet_estimateFee` would fail for any signed transaction.

This release updates pathfinder to use the correct chain ID.

### Fixed
* Testnet2 and integration flags are ignored
* `starknet_estimateFee` uses wrong chain ID for testnet2

### Changed
Updated to cairo-lang 0.10.3

## v0.4.2
Contains several bug fixes, mostly hotfixes for bugs introduced in v0.4.1.

### Added
Document that `--chain-id` expects text as input

### Fixed
* Testnet2 and integration L1 addresses are swapped (bug introduced in v0.4.1)
* Proxy network setups can't sync historical blocks (bug introduced in v0.4.1)
* ABI serialization for `starknet_estimateFee` for declare transactions


## v0.4.1

### Highlights
* Soft deprecation of some configuration options
* Support custom Starknet gateways
* Pathfinder RPC extensions at `/rpc/pathfinder/` with `pathfinder_version` method
* `starknet_events` optimisations
* fix block timestamp in pending calls
* Custom Starknet gateway support

This release introduces support for custom Starknets. You can select this network by setting `--network` custom and specifying the `--gateway-url` and `--feeder-gateway-url` options.

#### Configuration option deprecation
Several configuration options have been soft deprecated. This means using them will continue to work as before (no breaking change), but they will emit a warning when used. They will be removed in a future version, so please migrate to the newer options.

To re-emphasize: your current configuration setup will continue to work as is.

#### Network selection
`--testnet2` and `--integration` have been deprecated in favor of `--network` testnet2 and `--network` integration.

#### Gateway proxy
`--sequencer-url` has been deprecated in favor of `--network` custom along with `--gateway-url`, `--feeder-gateway-url` and `--chain-id`. In addition, you will need to rename your existing database file to custom.sqlite as this will be the expected filename for custom networks.

#### Configuration file
`--config` has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future. The utility this provided was valuable. Unfortunately it is starting to severely hinder how fast we can implement configuration changes and we decided to remove it.

We suggest using environment variables along with environment files to configure pathfinder in a similar fashion.

### Changed
The following configuration options are now marked as deprecated: `--testnet2`, `--integration`, `--config`, `--sequencer-url`
Optimized starknet_events for queries with both a block range and a from address

### Fixed
Block timestamps for pending in `starknet_call` and `starknet_estimateFee` were using the latest timestamp instead of the pending one. This meant contracts relying on accurate timestamps could sometimes fail unexpectedly.

### Added
* Custom Starknet support
* Pathfinder specific RPC extensions hosted at `<rpc-url>/rpc/pathfinder/v0.1`. Currently, this only contains `pathfinder_version` which returns the pathfinder version of the node.


## v0.4.0- (breaking release)
This release contains a breaking change, and also adds support for xref:documentation:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.2[Starknet v0.10.2].

The changes themselves are quite simple, but please read through each section as there are some caveats which might impact you when you apply this update.

###  Default RPC version change
This release changes the version of the RPC that is served at the root route, from v0.1 to v0.2 of the RPC specification. Version v0.1 is still available at the `/rpc/v0.1/` endpoint. This is the only breaking change in this release.

Here is a summary of what routes are currently available, and what's changed:

* `/` serves v0.2 (changed from v0.1)
* `/rpc/v0.1` serves v0.1 (no change)
* `/rpc/v0.2` serves v0.2 (no change)

If possible, we recommend that you use the version specific routes as this will prevent such breaking changes from impacting you.

### Starknet v0.10.2 support
This release includes an update to the cairo-vm embedded in pathfinder in order to support the upcoming v0.10.2 Starknet release. This bundled vm is a pre-release and may therefore contain differences to the final version used once Starknet updates testnet and mainnet. We will of course issue a new release if / when there is a new vm.

### Please take note of the following
Since these changes are not yet live on testnet nor mainnet, this means upgrading to this release will cause deviations between what pathfinder outputs and what can be expected on the network. More specifically, `starknet_estimateFee` will compute different fees until the network has upgraded to xref:documentation:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.2[Starknet v0.10.2].

If you don't need the RPC route changes, it may be pertinent to delay updating until closer to the xref:documentation:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.2[v0.10.2] release dates on testnet and mainnet. The expected timeline for these upgrades is ~17/11 for testnets and ~24/11 for mainnet.
